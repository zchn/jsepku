____________________________________________________________________


WinEdt 5 [Build 20050201 (v. 5.4)] (working beta build)
=======================================================

- A bug with refreshing line numbers (under certain circumstances)
have been fixed.

- A problem with using Stop; macro outside a Loop has  been fixed.

- A bug with automatic matching of toggled delimiters has been
fixed: $\{0,1,2,\dots,T\}$

- The new Macro Call can now be used inside loops

- Delete and Backspace in softly indented documents now do what one
would expect

- Roberts LaTeX Doc macro is now a part of the default settings for
MiKTeX and fpTeX: check it out in the Help Menu.

- EDT Mode has been updated with highlighting for recently added
macros.

- More documentation in the new Help and extended and revisited
Demo.tex (a LaTeX Sample in the Documents Menu).

- HTML Help sources for the new WinEdt Help are no longer included
in order to reduce the size of the download by a few MB. They will
be made available separately after the official release...

- Menu item for GSView has been modified so as to preview the
currently edited eps or ps file (when applicable).

- A few enhancements to the default settings and a few minor bug
fixes as communicated on the Mailing List

- (A rare) Access violation when rapidly closing lots of softly
wrapped maximized documents in a resized Window has been detected
and fixed.

- A problem (access violation) with using a mouse wheel in a tree
control with less than 3 items has been fixed.

- YandY Configuration (as it was) is now again included in the
defaults: all required files...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20050113 (v. 5.4)] (working beta build)
=======================================================

- A problem with WinEdt not starting when its Registry was corrupted
has been fixed. WinEdt now issues a warning message about it and
then continues to load...

- A bug with Run() that has an extra parameter Wait:0..1 has been
fixed: Append was interpreted as Wait and that could prevent WinEdt
from starting if any application launched with that parameter (eg.
GSView) during the previous session was still running...

- WinExe now automatically releases STD Handles when Input/ Output
stream is redirected to a file (no need to call
CloseSTDHandle(3);)...

- A bug with custom scroll wheel response in a tree control has been
fixed (sometimes a message "List index out of bounds (0)" would
popup up...

- YandY TeX Configuration is no longer included in the defaults.
Users that want to use WinEdt with their (properly installed) YandY
TeX will receive YandY.zip archive (31KB) that can be used to
install this no longer supported TeX configuration...

- Adobe macros have been improved to work with full Acrobat when
more than one document is loaded...

- A minor bug/ typo in the Insert Menu has been reported and fixed.

- More documentation (all dialogs have now been linked with the new
Help). Obsolete help system WinEdt.hlp is no longer included...

- The first version of (indexed) Macro Manual is included.


WinEdt 5 [Build 20041222 (v. 5.4)] (working beta build)
=======================================================

- A bug with auto-delimiter checking $$\$$ which caused WinEdt to
freeze when \ was inserted inside $$$$ has been fixed.

- A bug with reformatting a paragraph containing empty lines in Soft
Wrapping Mode has been fixed...

- Rewriting the menu on Win98 should no longer cause WinEdt to
crash.

- Changes to docked forms in Highlighting Dialog are now instant (no
need to restart WinEdt).

- Tree operations have been optimized (GetTreeEx and SetTreeEx are
much faster with long lists).

- Startup macro has been modified to correctly initialize Previous
View command for Adobe Reader 7. However, Adobe 7 has some internal
problems with placing MDI documents in the task bar creating extra
Tabs when more than one document is opened...

- Closing a project no longer automatically deletes the tree or
erases the file list. It is up to Prj-Close.edt event handler to do
it (if required). The macro DeleteTree has two extra parameters to
help with selective cleanup:

  DeleteTree(UseFlag: 0..1, Flag: $$0000..$$1111);
  //  UseFlag: 0..1
  //    0 delete the tree (as before)
  //    1 use flags to select the tasks
  //      Binary Flags from left to right $$0000..$$1111:
  //        Clear Gather Control
  //        Delete the Tree
  //        Clear File List
  //        Remove persistent Main File

  DeleteTree(1,$$1111); // The same as before...

- Removing the main file no longer deletes the tree. The default
menu command was changed from:

 [CMD('Remove Main File');DeleteTree;]
to:
 [CMD('Remove Main File');]

This makes re-establishing the previous main file easier... Set Main
File still rebuilds the tree (it does not hurt if it gets updated
now and then).

- A few minor fixes...

- More (but not ALL) dialogs are now linked to the new Help...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20041213 (v. 5.4)] (working beta build)
=======================================================

- A few minor corrections and fixes to the default settings and
installer options (as communicated on the Mailing List)...

- There is now only one Configuration Wizard with all actions and
less text.

- Most dialogs are now hooked to a new HTML Help System
(WinEdt.chm). The work on a new help continues (it has to be
indexed, proofread and completed with missing topics). The old Help
is still there but will eventually be completely replaced by the new
one for the official release.

Sources for the New Help are in Doc\Help folder (open WinEdt.hhc and
set it as a main file in order to have WinEdt build the project tree
and navigation bar with over 100 html topics currently available --
more to come).

Beside the Main Help WinEedt.chm there is also a working version of
what will become an indexed macro manual Macro.chm (sources are
included)...

Enhancements to WinEdtEx.ini and tree building functionality had to
be implemented in order to make WinEdt more suitable for HTML Help
authoring. HHC submode is used for this purpose. Accessories menu
contains an interface to HTML Compiler (hhc.exe). WinEdt will
automatically detect the executable from the registry if it is
properly installed - you can get a free HTML Help Workshop form MS
Downloads site... HTML Preview macro has been enhanced so that it
previews *.chm file while working on an HTML Help Project. Help
keyword macro has also been made context-sensitive and brings up a
different help depending on the mode of the current document.

After a while I found WinEdt better at managing a growing HTML Help
project that Help Workshop (I decided to use Soft format for HTML
files). Ideas from advanced users for improving HHC mode are welcome
(try it first)...

- An experiential "semi-soft" wrapping mode (as discussed on the
mailing list) has been implemented but remains to be carefully
tested...

- While documentation is a work in progress the Help Menu remains in
transition. It would be nice to compile (index and organize) the
Macro Manual into .chm as well but that would take quite some work.
Any suggestions or volunteers?

- Default settings no longer use the Pause options in Execution
Modes (because a few users were experiencing problems with such
console execution mode)... Better avoid such problems in defaults.
Help in Execution Modes now explains the details.

- A few Dialogs and interfaces have been simplified...

- More MDI Events in Preferences Dialog...

- Default Event Handler Macro Scripts have been moved to
Macros\Events subfolder. By default they also call Local\Event
handler (if it exists). They also restore tags and registers (to
avoid any problems when an event is triggered during search or
another macro execution).

- Similarly the Menus Folder contains many new macros used in the
Menu (in particular  Insert Menu has been reorganized)...

- Indented wrapping in Soft Mode.

- Options -> Configurations menu has been split into three menus:
      Configurations (MiKTeX, fpTeX, ...)
      Maintenance (Backup, Restore, Default...)
      Advanced (WinEdtEx.ini, Startup and TeX System macros)

- Automatic Delimiter matching now properly handles \left and \right
delimiters in TeX Mode.

- A few refreshing oddities (with background colors) have been
fixed.

- Nested Popup Menus now work as expected. Furthermore, macro Popup
now has an extra parameter for Sync execution:

 Popup("Popup Menu Name","Popup Menu Item",Visible:-1..1,SYNC:0..1);

 SYNC parameter suspends WinEdt until the (invisible) popup command
 is executed... Can be used in macros.

- WinEdt now detects screen resolution (eg. Large Fonts) and it
scales dialogs and forms according to the font size.

- Macro GlobalMark now has an integer parameter Tag:

   If a nonzero Tag is specified then the mark is set only if the
   last mark was not set with the same tag. This can come handy in
   Navigation Bar when inserting labels or citations with double click
   response while having tracking in source file enabled for single click.
   GlobalReturn resets the Tag back to 0 thus this functionality will
   work correctly if you change your mind and return back to the original
   position through Global Return command (in the toolbar of the Tree Form).

- Macro Run() now has an extra parameter Wait:0..1 that can be used
for synchronized execution of a sequence of applications (depending
on each others output)...

- New Macros for clean macro writing (especially in event handlers).
Ring Stack for Tags and Registers  0..15:

   PushTagsandRegisters;
   PopTagsandRegisters(Tags,Registers: -1..1111111111);
   GetTagStack(Register: 0..9);
   SetTagStack(StackPointer: 0..15);

  Pop macro allows selective restoring of tags and registers:
    -1 = none
     0 = all
     0..9 (mask)

  The last two macros are there mostly for debugging purposes
  (to detect bad macros that do not restore the stack)...

- New macro:

  IfScrollLock("Then","Else");

This allows extra qualifier for ALL shortcuts (not just arrows). For
example, those that are accustomed to an old IBM Keyboard can define
double functionality for arrow keys:

 [IfScrollLock(!"ScrollDown(1);",!"CMD('Line Down');");]
 [IfScrollLock(!"ScrollUp(1);",!"CMD('Line Up');");]
 [IfScrollLock(!"ScrollRight(1);",!"CMD('Char Right');");]
 [IfScrollLock(!"ScrollLeft(1);",!"CMD('Char Left');");]

IfScrollLock always returns false unless the option

  Enable "Scroll Lock" Key

in Preferences| Shell Dialog is enabled!

- New Macro:
  IfKeyDown(Key:0..255,toggled,async:0..1,"Then","Else");

This macro can be used in custom keyboard interfaces.

Examples:

  IfKeyDown(145,1,0,"Prompt('Scroll Lock');");
  IfKeyDown(144,1,0,"Prompt('Num Lock');");
  IfKeyDown(20,1,0,"Prompt('CapsLock');");
  IfKeyDown(16,0,0,"Prompt('Shift Down');");
  IfKeyDown(18,0,0,"Prompt('Alt Down');");
  IfKeyDown(1,0,0,"Prompt('Left Mouse Button Down');");

etc...

  Virtual Key codes are described in the Macro Manual...

- Sectioning commands in WinEdtEx.ini now allow (multiple)
specifications like:
  ITEM="\subsection{?}"
    ALT="\subsection[?]"
    ALT="\subsection*{?}"
    ALT="\subsection*[?]"
This should reduce unwanted entries when a wildcard is being used
instead \subsection?{?}...

- BEGINNING_OF_LINE_ONLY filter in TOC now allows values 0..2.

  0 - any position
  1 - allows indented
  2 - must start in the first column

- The same in GATHER control...

- Highlighting Dialog now allows Custom Font and background color
for docked forms (they are imported and exported as a part of
Background Schemes)

- VCL Application Form Fix:

  > - Opening two windows (WinEdt and another application) with
  > Ctrl-Click I often put WinEdt in one half of the screen and Yap in
  > the other. However, the method under Windows to right-click on both
  > programs with Ctrl pressed does not work as the WinEdt window
  > doesn't adjust properly. This happened already in version 5.3.

  This is an old issue with ALL Delphi applications.

  However, after a few weeks of messing up with Delphi's VCL I managed
  to fix it:

  Options -> Preferences | Advanced now (next build) has an option
  "Delphi Application Style". With this option disabled WinEdt reverses
  the creation of its Main Form and Application Handle (which is then
  created as a child of the Main Form). This ensures standard behavior
  of WinEdt in the task bar and eliminates problems with tiling
  applications (well there is more to it but this summarizes
  the issue)... With this option enabled everything is as it
  was...

- Problems with MS Virtual Desktop Manager have been fixed (WinEdt
no longer "insists" on being displayed in task bars for all 4
virtual monitors). The same reason as above....

- New Macros for macro execution flow:
    Call(Label");
    Return;
    JMP("Label");
    GetCallStack(Reg: 0..9, #0..1);

- New Macro (used to reduce oddities with Insert Environments
  Macros in Soft Mode):
    TrimLine(LetOfCaret: 0..1);

- New Macros (instead of no longer existing TeX and Shell Wizards):
    ShowLicenseMonitor;
    SearchForFile(#0..9,"filename","Directory List");
      If List is empty Windows PATH Environmental Variable is
      Searched...

- New Macro (consistent with other similar ones):
    ShowToolBar(#0..2);

- Old previously unfinished macro (inverse of GetTreeEx):

    SetTreeEx("String Data");
      Data must be in the same format as returned by GetTreeEx
      (properly indented with line numbers and Item Index
       at the end (?):[?])...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20040513 (v. 5.4)] (beta build)
===============================================

- A few minor corrections and fixes to the default settings and
installer options (as communicated on the Mailing List)...

- Open dialog now allows multiple file selections (as it should)...

- A problem with DDE Server functionality during synchronized
execution has been fixed. MUI plug-in works with this build (it did
not with the previous one)...

- Rewriting the menu in response to a shortcut no longer results in
an error ("List Index out of bounds (-1)")

- GUI control now contains two extra buttons for \mathds{} and
\mathfrak{} (in the same group as \mathbb{}, \mathbf{}, \mathcal{}
and \mathrm{})...

- By default [PDF]TeXify no longer uses Clean Build because a few
users complained that they can no longer open the log file after
TeXify-ing (that is because with clean build option TeXify deletes
log and aux , etc... files after a compilation)... Those that feel
strongly for "clean" TeXify-ing will have to customize their
preferred execution mode (and create a backup of it for future
upgrades -backup and restore is just a click on the button in the
Execution Modes interface)...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20040504 (v. 5.4)] (beta build)
===============================================

- WinEdt Setup (winedt54.exe) is compiled with INNO Setup Compiler
(see http://www.innosetup.com). WinEdt's INNO setup files are
included in WinShell\INNO Setup folder (advance users can take a
look to see exactly what components are preserved during the
installation)... The file Administrator.txt in WinShell\Profiles
folder explains how to perform a silent install or uninstall and how
to configure concurrent license monitoring (if necessary)...

- This build has been compiled with Delphi 7 Professional (as oppose
to previous version that used an older compiler Delphi 5). This
should make the appearance more XP-themes compatible...

- Default settings have been slightly modified. In particular, the
local folder is no longer overwritten during upgrades and users can
place customized configuration files or macros there... WinEdtEx.ini
that is actually used by default is now in %b folder and it can be
modified (backup Restore and Default commands can be used to archive
this configuration file - see below for more additions and changes
in WinEdtEx.ini). User.dic is never overwritten during upgrades and
the installer allows an option to preserve previous settings
(WinEdt.ini)...

- Uninstall now completely removes WinEdt, its application folder
and cleans up the registry: use with care unless you want to
completely remove WinEdt and all its subfolders from you system...

- A known issue with "Range Check Error" (when no project tree is
present) has been addressed...

- Fixes and enhancements in the default settings as communicated on
the Mailing List.

- A few minor bug fixes (especially the ones related to Soft
wrapping oddities)...

- Dialogs are no longer scaled depending on the resolution. This
should eliminate bad appearance of Tab pages under some
circumstances (eg. switching to Asian Locale)...

- Appearance Dialog allows specification of Large Toolbar Icons. On
Systems with resolution 1600x1200 (or more) this may improve the
appearance of the program. Unfortunately, large bitmaps haven't been
re-created manually (time-consuming task!) and have been simply
scaled by factor 2. Should anyone with time at hand prepare better
looking large images (32x32 or even 48x48) to be included in the
defaults let me know... Even if only the most commonly used images
are improved it would worth the effort...

- GUI control can be enlarged through the interface in the
Appearances Dialog. On high-resolution screen non-flat (3-D) button
appearance with 115% enlargement looks better (especially on XP).
You can experiment until you get optimal result on your system...

- Document Tabs allow closing on double-click option (Appearance|
Tabs).

- Menu Setup| Advanced dialog now allows more control over the
presence of Hot Keys and Persistent Accelerators in visible Popup
Menus...

- Shell configuration Wizard now allows specification of Startup
folder...

- Filetype associations interface also allows specification of any
extra switches (such as -V if you want WinEdt not to load a project
when started by double-clicking an associated file).

- Concurrent License Monitoring (for network installations) has been
implemented and is now documented in

  "...ShellConfig\Profiles\Administartor.txt."

Shell Configuration Wizard allow you to set it up and monitor the
usage (intended mostly for system administrators and advanced
users)...

- Background attributes for current line can now be specified in the
Highlighting| Background Schemes Dialog...


WinEdtEx:
=========

- LoadConfig() macro now has an extra parameter that allows you to
append new items to the existing (default) data:

    LoadConfig("INI File Name",Append:0..1);

This makes it possible to have more than one WinEdtEx.ini file for
mode-specific tasks...

- Items in the Navigation Bar (TOC) in WinEdtEx.ini now allow and
extra option:

    BALANCED="{}\"

This option forces WinEdt to collect balanced wildcards and thus
properly display TOC in case the title contains nested braces. The
third (optional) character in the string ignores control characters
\{ and \} which do not have to balanced if control character is
specified...

This string can also be used to collect data with ANSI Strings and
strings using an ESCAPE convention by setting:

    BALANCED="""""" or BALANCED="''" (depending on ANSI Quote)
and
    BALANCED="\", (depending on the ESCAPE character)

respectively. Defaults have been fixed appropriately...

- Items in WinEdt.gdi also allow an extra Balanced parameter with
the same meaning as TOC...

- Some users also wanted TOC Items to be cleared of labels etc...
This is now possible by specifying a set of RegEx substitutions that
are performed before the item is placed in the tree. Default for TeX
do the following:

    SUBSTITUTION="\label{*}"
      SUB_FIND="\\label\{*\}"
      SUB_REPLACE=""
      SUB_REG_EX=1
      SUB_CASE_SENSITIVE=1
    SUBSTITUTION="  "
      SUB_FIND=" +{ }"
      SUB_REPLACE=" "
      SUB_REG_EX=1
      SUB_CASE_SENSITIVE=1
    SUBSTITUTION="\ldots"
      SUB_FIND="\ldots"
      SUB_REPLACE="..."
      SUB_REG_EX=0
      SUB_CASE_SENSITIVE=1

to remove labels, multiple spaces and change "\ldots" to "...".
There is no limit on the number of substitutions but some restrain
should be exercised if you don't want to affect the performance too
much...

- BuildTree macro now has a parameter TreeEx which determines if
Branches defined in WinEdtEx.ini (such as TOC) are build as well:

  BuildTree(Rebuild: -1..1);
    -1 - never
     0 - only if tree control is visible
     1 - always

- BRANCH_SORTED=1 now works as intended (before it was ignored):
    the branch items are sorted depending on preferences in the
    Sort Dialog (Table,Ascending and Case Sensitive)...

- *** IMPORTANT: The following Keywords in [DOCUMENT_TABS] are no
longer recognized in WinEdtEx.ini:

  VISIBLE
  MULTILINE
  SCROLL_OPOSITE
  DISPLAY_FILETYPES
  HOT_TRACKING
  CUSTOM_COLORS
  TEXT_COLOR

They can be set the Appearance Dialog and were ignored anyway. For
the official release it looks like a good idea to clear WinEdtEx
from ignored attributes but users that have customized this behavior
may have to manually delete a few lines from WinEdtEx.ini before it
can be successfully loaded in a new version.

WinExe and Execution Modes:
===========================

- WinEdt now provide new execution modes interface. It can be
started through the TeX Configuration Wizard or directly from the
(default) Options Menu. The idea is to give users easy control over
extra switches passed to default accessories (including paper size
specification for converters that allow such command-line switches).

- Macro WinExe has an extra parameter to allow more control over
execution of console applications.

 WinExe("Executable","Command Line","Startup Folder","Caption",
        Flags:00000000..11111111, Priority: -1..1,
        "STD Input","STD Output","STD Error",
        Pause: 0..111);

     Pause (a combination of):
        100 - Pause only if Console is still in the foreground
        010 - Pause if OK    (Exit Code =0)
        001 - Pause if Error (Exit Code<>0)

Specifying this flag is ignored in Detached or Background mode. The
flag imposes the use of STDIO with console CONIN$, CONOUT$ and
CONERR$ for STD IO (specified STD files are ignored).

Flag 100 will always cause WinEdt to prevent automatic console
closing if the application launching fails thus allowing you to read
what's wrong (eg. missing executable or dll or invalid switch or
parameter). It is recommended that this flag is ON even if you are
not interested in console output...

This can be used to avoid using problematic BATCH files (spaces in
filenames, etc...) for users that want the console to remain opened
after the process is finished until they press any key. This may not
work on Win9x/ME because implementation has to take advantage of
advanced console creation functions and handlers (some only
available on NT,2000,XP).

     Flags have been extended with two extra options:
       100000000 - Force Focus
       010000000 - Focus Existing Application with the same
                   caption (if it exists)

       This way WinExe is in every respect extension of a simpler
       Run() macro...

- Execution Modes have been redone to allow easy specification of
common switches (eg. Paper Size and Orientation). The new interface
requires more macros. This macros are of no concern to ordinary
users but can be (and are) used to prepare a GUI that allows such
users to make selections pertaining to how they want their
compilation(s) to run [including specification of extra switches].

  ShowExecutionModes('Caption','Output','Backup','Custom',
        'Default','Direct','Pause','Detached','BATCH');
    Show The interface (after all of the AddApplication macros
    have been processed). The user can now make selections through
    GUI and the result is saved in the specified Output Macro
    File. The result assigns 1 to all enabled variables in a
    specified Output Macro. The macros in Exec folders take these
    variables into consideration when launching an application...

  AddApplication('Name','Executable','Switches','Parameters',
   'Environmental Variable',
    EnablePaperSize: 0..1, EnableLandscape: 0..1,
    EnableFlags: 0..999999999, EnableAttributes: 0..999999999);

  If Environmental Variable is a non-empty string that this
  variable is assigned the name of the executable...

  The Flags have to be specified a combination of binary masks
  $$10101.... Only checkboxes with the flag 1 will be enabled in
  the interface. The meaning is described in the macro manual...

- A new macro to be used for entering switches on spot like
ExternalPrint(); but more compatible with the new Execution Modes
interface:

  EnterSwitches("Application",Use_Previous_Value: -1..1,
    Landscape_Enabled: 0..1, Page_Size_Enabled: 0..1,
    Page_Selection_Enabled: 0..1,"From_Switch","To Switch");

Check for example dvi2ps.edt to see how to use this macro...

- A new macro that allows assignment of global registers %0...%9 and
provides a drop down interface with previous values:

  EnterString("Prompt","Caption",Register:0..9,
               Sorted:-1..1,
               CustomFont:-1..1,
               AutoComplete:-1..1,
               AutoDropDown:-1..1,
               AutoCloseUp: -1..1,
               Width,Height:0..999,
               RestoreFlag:0..1111);

Default value 0 uses the current setting for size or property.
Defaults can be changed in the Popup Menu in the dialog interface or
in case of size by resizing the dialog... Win9x/ME/NT may not
respond to all Auto* properties in the drop-down list.

A common use of this function will only specify the first three
parameters...

Restore Flag can be specified to restore previous values for any
combination of the following:

  0001 - Sorted
  0010 - Custom Font
  0100 - Auto Drop Down List Properties
  1000 - Size

Note: Global registers %0,%1 and %2 are being used in the default
settings and should not be used in custom macros to avoid conflicts
with the default configurations...

- The function LoadToolBar (used in configuration components that
  require custom toolbar) has been extended:

  LoadToolBar("Filename", LayoutOnly: 0..1);

With LayoutOnly flag set to 1 nonessential toolbar attributes (such
as the size and 3-D/ flat appearance of buttons) are ignored...

- Regular Expression extensions:
  ==============================

  \"'ANSI String'

      This can be used to avoid extensive "escaping". Eg.

      <\"'\label{...}'

      instead of a longer and more error prone equivalent

      <\\label\{\.\.\.\}

      (any character can be used for string delimiter and it has to be
      repeated twice if it is to appear in the string).

  \S{Find}{Substitute}{RegEx}
     can be used in powerful Replace RegEx
  \s{Find}{Substitute}{RegEx}
     the same except that ordinary (non-RegEx) substitution is performed
     it is faster when RegEx is not required while replacing

       Search for: "<\(Journal+{-+[a-z]}\)"
       Replace with: "\s{-}{ }{\0}"

    Is a good example for this one (Tags would not be useful in
    Replacing because we don't know how many words are in a phrase).

  Powerful Extension:
  ===================

  \X{Macro to be executed}
     IfOK status determines if match is OK
  Can be used to collect all labels that are never referred to, etc...
  Specify Macro inside as an ANSI String (unless you want to use hot Tags!)

  \x{Macro to be executed}
     The same except that not IfOK is used

  \Xx{Macro to be executed}
  \xX{Macro to be executed}
     The same but it does not affect matching directly

    If %!1 contains all \ref items then the following finds labels
    that are not being referred to:

    \\label{\{\(*\)\}}\x{\"|GetTag(0,2);FindInString("%!1","%!2");|}

    and this gives only the ones that are being used:

    \\label{\{\(*\)\}}\X{\"|GetTag(0,2);FindInString("%!1","%!2");|}

    Note it is important to use: {\{\(*\)\}} because \{\(*\)\} will
    not work here! One can use SetOK explicitly...

    In this case a simple form:

    \\label{\{\(*\)\}}\X{FindInString("%!1","\0");}

    works as well but it is safer to enclose macro in "quotes" to
    avoid any problems with characters that have a special meaning
    in RegEx...

- New Macros (for clean macro script writing):

    SaveRegisters(Flag: 0..1111111111);
    RestoreRegisters(Flag: 0..1111111111);
    ClearRegisters(Flag: 0..1111111111);
    ClearSavedRegisters(Flag: 0..1111111111);

Flag stands for Registers 0..9 (from left to right). Only registers
with flag 1 are affected...

- New Macro to make WinEdt more responsive in macros that take a
long time to finish. Use with care as it may cause sync problems if
used at the wrong spot:

    ProcessMessages;

- Bookmark and Line numbers panels have been given a 3-d appearance
and the background schemes now allow specification of background
color and font attributes for current line, thus making current
position more visible. Defaults do not use this option but it is
easy to activate it in the Highlighting Dialog...

- Find and Replace Dialogs now have Auto Scope option enabled and
Replace All in Selected text restores the selection to its previous
state after replacing is finished. Selection can also be restored
manually by the new RestoreSelection macro in the tools menu
(F10)...

- New Macros (by default in Tools Menu):

   MarkSelection(CurrentMark: 0..9, SelectedMark:0..9);
   RestoreSelection(CurrentMark: 0..9, SelectedMark:0..9);

- New macro to make Replacing in Strings easier (rather than a loop
with FindInString and ReplaceInString):

 SubstituteInString("String","Find_Str","Replace_Str", Flags:0, Result:0..9);

   Replace all instances of Find_Str in String with Replace_Str
   and store the result in the %!<Result> register
   Flags (same as ReplaceInString)::
           0 - default
           1 - Regular Expression
          10 - Case Sensitive
         100 - Respect Capitalization (ignored with Case Sensitive!)
        1000 - use UNIX EOLN format (LF instead of CR+LF)

- Advanced feature (for users that are preparing configuration
components that require menu additions):

In Extracted Menu Files (eg. Main Menu.dat) as used for importing
additional configurations it is now possible to specify shortcuts
directly rather than using Windows Shortcut Code. This can be slow
if many shortcuts would be frequently loaded like this but it can
come handy if you want to specify a few shortcuts directly in
Menu.dat file (rather than relying on WinEdt's Import/ Export
functionality to update the shortcut).

Example:

MENU:&Accessories
  Flags:0
  Hint:
  Macro:387
    Item:&TeX
    Hint: TeX
    File:"%!M=TeX"
    Path:%P
    Definition:Exe('%B\Exec\MiKTeX\TeX.edt');
    Shortcut:24660 [Shift+Ctrl+T]
    Tool Bar:61
    Image:206

You can now specify a different shortcut directly as follows:

    Shortcut:[Shift+Ctrl+Alt+T]

If "Shortcut:" is followed by a number than this (much faster)
specification is used and the string is ignored when the item is
loaded; otherwise WinEdt parses the string and computes the actual
shortcut code...

Note menu is language dependent and the actual shortcut as displayed
in the menu may be different (eg. ALT can be displayed as GRAVE in
non-English locales). In Menu.dat files you must always use
Shift/Ctrl/Alt quantifiers (they will be properly displayed in the
menu once WinEdt calculates the code- the specified string is not
used in the actual menu).


WinEdt 5 [Build 20031209 (v. 5.4)] (beta build)
===============================================

- A few bug fixes and minor changes to the default settings as
communicated on the Mailing List...

- Exec macros have been extended and modified to cover Acrobat 6
(problem with locked files).

- GUI control has been modified so that it now "adjust" to different
backgrounds...

- New option "Show Line Numbers for Modes" in the Appearance|
Bookmarks dialog. This determines the visibility of the line number
panel when a document is initially opened. By default Ctrl+= toggles
visibility of line numbers and the property is preserved on
per-document basis in the project file...

- Changes to the Switches Dialog (an extra option that allows to
control whether the Start and End Trigger are highlighted the same
as the switch). Here is the new meaning of the options:

  - The Start Option now indicates that the switch becomes effective
  immediately.

  - The End option has the same meaning as before: if checked the end
  trigger is stepped over (essential for toggled and nested
  environments). However, the switch attributes are applied to the
  end trigger only if the Option in front of the Scope is checked.

  - The Switches dialog now has a new option BOLN which indicates that
  the switch only applies in the beginning of line (useful for
  things like Fortran comments). Previously the option in front of
  the Start trigger had this meaning (far from intuitive).

Old Highlighting settings will be correctly imported (without any
intervention on users side).

- Switch can also have an attribute "Indented". When this option is
checked the switch does not apply to the leading spaces inside
environments...

- More "Require *" properties in the Menu Setup Dialog
   - Requires Clipboard text (eg. Paste from Clipboard)
   - Requires Main File      (eg. Remove Main File)
   - Requires a Modified Doc (eg. Save All)

- Event Handlers for BuildTree (see Project Manager Dialog).
  Before means before the navigation Bar is build but after the
  File inclusion part has been build. After is executed after
  WinEdt is done with building the tree and navigation bar.

- New Macro:

  GetFileTimeStamp("Filename",Register:0..9);

  Returns @+16 HEX digit representing 64-bit
  file time stamp identifier.
    It can be compared with IfStr(...);
    (not IfNum which uses smaller 32-bit integers).

- %X Full name of the currently executed macro file
  %C Path of the currently executed macro file

- Document Tabs can now be rearranged by "drag-and-drop" and the
context popup menu has extended sorting capabilities to reorder
document tabs...

- New Macro:

  SortDocumentTabs(Flags:-1..1111,Descending:0..1);

  Flags:
    -1 - MDI Order
     0 - Full path and filename
  The following can be combined (from left to right):
    0001 - Path
    0010 - Name
    0100 - Type
    1000 - Mode
  Thus 0 is an equivalent (short way) of specifying 0111.

- Filelist interface (Complete File List) now allow extra sorting
commands and list manipulation (removing files, hiding the PATH)
through a newly added toolbar...

- Extended Macros:
    ScrollUp(Lines,MakeCaretVisible:0..1);
    ScrollDown(Lines,MakeCaretVisible:0..1);

- New Macro:

    GetTreeEx(Reg: 0..9,"Branch Name");
 If Branch Name is empty then the whole contents of the Navigation
 Bar is copied as a string into the specified register. Defaults
 for now only have "TOC" for TeX and HTML mode, respectively...
 Each Item in the branch consists of 3 lines (except for the
 branch itself which starts in the first column and consists only
 of a branch name). A Branch must be defined in WinEdtEx.ini!

    SetTreeEx("String Data");
      Data must be in the same format as returned by GetTreeEx
      (properly indented with line numbers and Item Index
       at the end (?):[?])...

      Example 1:

       <TOC:[0]
        >C:\Alex\WinEdt\Samples\Thesis\Abs.tex(2):[9]
          *\prefacesection{Abstract}

WinEdt 5 [Build 20030429 (v. 5.4)] (private build)
==================================================

- Gather Interface and the Tree (Navigation Bar) did not properly
enumerate lines numbers in softly wrapped documents. This has now
been fixed...

- A crash with Building a tree (TOC) in deeply nested HTML files
have been fixed.

- A bug with losing the "Persistent Main File" and "Relative File
List" in the Project manager dialog when rebuilding the tree has
been fixed.

- A Bug with right-clicking on a misspelled word has been fixed
(WinEdt now provides a context sensitive response: spell check
dialog with a list of spelling suggestions).

- A series of problems with non RegEx not inline search have been
fixed (especially in Soft documents). This is a search for strings
containing spaces that can span over two lines...

- Incompatibilities with Highlighting (background color for
switches) have been addressed. The defaults have been modified to
display math environments with a different background.

- Misspelled option BEGINING_OF_LINE_ONLY has been corrected to
BEGINNING_OF_LINE_ONLY. If you want to keep your custom WinEdtEx.ini
then you'll have to perform a Replace of the above string before new
WinEdt will successfully load it... The one that comes with WinEdt
has been fixed.

- In the Navigation Bar (WinEdtEx.ini) there are now additional
custom responses for:

    ON_CTRL_CLICK
    ON_CTRL_DBL_CLICK
    ON_SHIFT_CLICK
    ON_SHIFT_DBL_CLICK
    ON_ALT_CLICK
    ON_ALT_DBL_CLICK

beside the:

    ON_CLICK
    ON_DBL_CLICK

- In the Navigation Bar (WinEdtEx.ini) items now have an extra
property:

    RETURN_AT_EOF=0..1   (0=no 1=yes)

  This is intended for better tree appearance in case you want the
  include directives to be in the same branch as TOC (not
  default). It all depends on how you use input directives in
  combination with sectioning commands...

- In the Navigation Bar (WinEdtEx.ini) items now have an extra
property:

    BRANCH_EXPANDED=0..2 (0-no, 1-yes on level 1, 2=fully expanded)

By default TOC Branch is expanded on level 1...

- WinEdt now remembers the selected item in the TOC Branch and makes
sure that it is visible and selected after the tree is rebuild
(assuming that the document has not been rearranged beyond the
recognition).

- A New (advanced but useful with RCS) property of Document Tab
Icons:

    RESET_TAG=New_Tag_Value
      Can be used to "remember" that the document was in certain
      state (eg. Modified) When the document reaches a state
      (Selector) with non-zero RESET_FLAG Documents's tag is reset
      to this value (no other action is taken)...

- A bug fix with the macros (they did not work in previous Build):

   CLToIndex(1,2,3,"String");
   IndexToCL(1,2,3,"String");

- Find in Files did not find the appropriate line if the string was
found in the last line of softly wrapped document. Fixed.

- New Macros to allow taking advantage of Find in Files
functionality behind the scenes:

  FindNext(Direction: -4..4; Track: -1..1; TrackListView: 0..1);

  Direction:
       0 Stay where you are
    +/-1 Next/Previous instance
    +/-2 Next/Previous line
    +/-3 Next/Previous file
    +/-4 the last/first item
  Track:
    -1..1: Off, Default, On
  TrackListView:
    0..1: Off, On
     If List is Visible tracking the selected item in the list
     makes macros slow dues to unnecessary refreshing and
     scrolling in the list...

  GetFindItem(Reg: 0..9; Object: 0..6);

  Object:
    0 Current Item Actual Found String:
              After this call with tagged RegEx one can use FindInString
              and after that GetTag macros to process parameters...
    1 Current Item (as displayed in the list)
    2 Current Item File
    3 Current Item Line/ Paragraph (Soft) Index
    4 Current Item Column/ Paragraph Offset (Soft) Index
    5 Current Item Index
    6 Total Number of Items

IfOK responding properly to allow iteration.

Note that in combination with:

    FindInFiles;
    ShowCollectForm(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindFilesOnly(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesSelected(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesCurrent(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesOpened(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesProject(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesFolders(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesSubfolders(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesModeFilter("Mode1;Mode2");
    SetFindinFilesTypeFilter(".type1;.type2"));
    SetFindRoot("PATH");

This allows you to collect and process data without ever having to
see the actual interface (FindInFiles does not show it) and without
any focus shifting...

  Example:
  ========

  One can write a macro that collects all graphics directives and
  process them one by one (eg. by converting eps files to pdf or
  png for pdf processing).

  I didn't get around to test it but a sample below works:

    // Sample code to enumerate found items
      SaveFind;
      SetFindinFilesProject(1);
      SetRegEx(1);
      SetFindStr("\\include\{*\}");
      SearchReset;
      FindInFiles;
      RestoreFind;

      FindNext(-4,-1);
      Loop(!|>
        GetFindItem(0,0);>
        IfOK(!'>
          FindInString("%!0", "\\include\{\(*\)\}", 0,1, 11);>
          IfOK(!*>
            GetTag(0,1);>
            GetFullPath(1,"%!1.tex","%P");>
            Prompt("%!1"); //Do something more useful like running gswin32c.exe here<>
          *,>
          *Relax;*);>
        ',>
        'Stop;');>
        FindNext(1,-1);|);

    End;

    // Sample code to copy found items into clipboard
      StartWorking('Copying...');
      LetReg(1,'');
      FindNext(-4,-1,0);
      Loop(!|>
        GetFindItem(0,0);>
        IfOK(!'>
          LetReg(1,"%!1%\%!0");>
        ',>
        'Stop;');>
        FindNext(1,-1,0);|);

      CopyToClipboard("%!1");
      FindNext(-4,-1,1);
      LetReg(1,'');
      LetReg(0,'');
      StopWorking;

    End;

- Options to use filters in the Find in Files Dialog interface have
been removed. They were deemed redundant since leaving the filter
empty does the job and it is easy to forget to check or uncheck the
options.

  Consequently the following Macro functions no longer exist:

    SetFindUseModeFilter(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindUseTypeFilter(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);

- Extension to GDIPopup Macro:

 GDIPopup("Page","Caption",Refresh,Sort,Track_onClick,
           Track_onDblClick,OK_onDblClick: 0..1,
           "Selected Item","Filter",Remove_Filter: 0..1);
   This function is used in Active String Response to \ref{} and
   \cite{}. It allows a keyboard interface to find and insert a label.
   If you specify an Item than this Item is initially selected...

   If you specify a non-empty filter string then only items starting
   with this string are displayed. These string can (optionally)
   be removed from the displayed items (since it is irrelevant).


WinEdt 5 [Build 20030401 (v. 5.4)] (private build)
==================================================

- Minor Bug Fixes and numerous small enhancements...

- Find in Files functionality to collect strings (or WinEdt's
  RegEx) in  files or current project tree. "Find In Files"
  interface is located in the second Tab Page in the Find dialog
  (Ctrl+F)...

  In the Appearance| Docking Dialog you can dock the Collect Form
  in which the found items are displayed. By default it is not
  docked but you may want to have it docked at the bottom of the
  screen (similar to Gather Form).

  A Bunch of macros to provide additional interface to this
  functionality:
    FindInFiles;
    ShowCollectForm(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindFilesOnly(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesCurrent(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesOpened(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesProject(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesFolders(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesSubfolders(No_Toggle_Yes: -1..1);
    SetFindinFilesModeFilter("Mode1;Mode2");
    SetFindinFilesTypeFilter(".type1;.type2"));
    SetFindRoot("PATH");


- WinEdt 5.4 now looks better on Windows XP (some controls have been
upgraded to have an XP look). However, if you want the Document Tabs
to look XP-ish you must disable the option "Custom Colors" in the
Appearance| Document Tabs Dialogs. There is now a different way to
indicate the document status by using Icons (see below about
extensions in WinEdtEx.ini). This limitation is due to a conflict
between the Tab Appearance and custom painting of their contents
(somewhere deep in Windows API or Delphi but I was not able to find
a way around). If you prefer the current Tab appearance then comment
out the section [DOCUMENT_TABS] in WinEdtEx.ini (see information
below)...

- WinEdtEx.ini provides an interface to extended functionality.
Unlike WinEdt.ini this file can/ must be edited and this is the only
way to change certain settings that rely on this file. Currently the
following sections are implemented:

  [DOCUMENT_TABS]
  [NAVIGATION_BAR]
  [INPUT_DIRECTIVES]

The file can be edited (based on the templates provided in the
default settings). You don't have to use all or any of the new
features provided in this interface but you may have to modify the
above file. Use common sense and care when making modifications
since the file can be corrupted and you'll use your custom settings
until you fix the syntax errors introduced by careless editing.
Create a backup to avoid disasters!


- New Macro function to load or re-load WinEdtEx format file:

    LoadConfig("INI File Name");

Startup macro should start with something like:

  Requires(20030330);

  IfFileExists('%b\Local\WinEdtEx.ini',>
    !"LoadConfig('%b\Local\WinEdtEx.ini');",>
    !"IfFileExists('%B\Local\WinEdtEx.ini',>
      !""LoadConfig('%B\Local\WinEdtEx.ini');"");");

after you place the WinEdtEx.ini in your Local WinEdt folder (if you
created a user profile that's in your application data folder or
else in WinEdt's Root folder).

- Improved Navigation capabilities (combining the Gather and
  Tree functionality inside the Tree Control). By default the tree
  shows document structure and included graphics. This can be
  customized in WinEdtEx.ini:

[NAVIGATION_BAR]

BRANCH="TOC"
  BRANCH_MODE="TeX"
  BRANCH_ICON="TOC"
  BRANCH_SORTED=0
  BRANCH_CASE_SENSITIVE=1
  BRANCH_IGNORE_COMMENTS=1

  ITEM="\chapter?{?}"
    MODE="TeX"
    CASE_SENSITIVE=1
    BEGINING_OF_LINE_ONLY=1
    CURRENT_DOCUMENT_ONLY=0
    ALL_OPENED_DOCUMENTS=0
    COMPLETE_PROJECT_TREE=1
    ICON="Chapter"
    LEVEL=8
    CAPTION="%?"
    MAX_LINE_SPAN=3
    ON_CLICK="TreeTrack(2);"
    ON_DBL_CLICK="Relax;"
    ACTION="Find"
      MENU_ICON="Find"
      MACRO="TreeTrack(2);"

  etc..

Note that the LEVEL attribute determines how the items are nested
(it is a good idea to leave some breathing space if you later decide
to insert more items, eg. Parts contains Chapters)...

  New Macros used in these files:

    Used in responses for currently selected item:

      TreeTrack(SelMode: 0..9, filter=0..2);
         filter - 0 None
                  1 Only if Open on Click is enabled
                  2 Only if Open on Double-Click is enabled
      TreeGetFileName(Reg: 0..9);
      TreeGetLineNumber(Reg: 0..9);

- How the graphics is collected in the Navigation Bar and displayed:

  ITEM="\includegraphics?{?}"
    MODE="TeX"
    CASE_SENSITIVE=1
    BEGINING_OF_LINE_ONLY=0
    CURRENT_DOCUMENT_ONLY=0
    ALL_OPENED_DOCUMENTS=0
    COMPLETE_PROJECT_TREE=1
    ICON="Image"
    LEVEL=0
    CAPTION="Image: %?"
    ON_CLICK="TreeTrack(2);"
    ON_DBL_CLICK="Exe('%b\Macros\GraphicsPreview.edt');"
    // %? is filename possibly without extension
    ACTION="Find"
      MENU_ICON="Find"
      MACRO="TreeTrack(2);"
    ACTION="Preview"
      MENU_ICON="View"
      MACRO="Exe('%b\Macros\GraphicsPreview.edt');"

You must place GraphicsPreview.edt macro in your Local or WinEdt
Global Macros folder.

The macro searches for common graphics extension (you can change the
order) and uses ShellExecute command to display the graphics. This,
too, can be changed if you have a different favorite previewer or if
your graphics files are not associated with any application. How
this works depends on how is your system configured since WinEdt at
the moment does not provide a custom previewer:

The following macro function was implemented to make the macro
shorter (since the Graphics files are usually located relatively to
the main file):

    GetFullPath(Reg: 0..9,"FileName","Root PATH");

If you want to make changes you must customize the macro
GraphicsPreview.edt...

- Input Directives can be specified to suppress and extend of the
functionality in the Preferences| Input Dialog. Directives now have
more attributes regarding recursion and can be specified in
mode-dependent groups.

[INPUT_DIRECTIVES]

INPUT="TeX"
  MODE="TeX"

- Document can be tagged with special attributes (eg. their status
  in RCS). A document icon displayed in the Tab Control (next to
  the document name) can be configured so as to depend on the Tag.

    SetDocTabIconTag(Tag: #0..999999999,"Document Name");
    GetDocTabIconTag(Reg: 0..9,"Document Name");

  WinEdt does not care about the meaning of the Tag. Document
  Icons in the Tab controls can indicate if the file is locked,
  readonly, modified (many combinations and the default use only a
  few). This can be tuned in WinEdtEx.ini...

- A new option in the Dictionary Manager:

    Check Only words containing 7-bit ASCII characters

  in Spell Checking Options Tab Page.

  This option is intended to make English/ Asian (or any foreign)
  mixed editing easier because it allows you to spell check the
  English (7-bit ASCII) portion of the text without highlighting
  foreign (8-bit extensions) words as misspelled (if there is no
  dictionary available for this language). For example, Asian
  (CJK) users will benefit from this as will Hebrew and Arab
  and possibly other multi-lingual users...

- Exe("Macro") function is now more flexible. If you specify %b in
  a filename or folder and the file does not exist then the
  function tries %B instead. This should make it easier to write
  User Profile friendly macros (use %b and WinEdt will execute the
  default in its root folder if the user did not overwrite it).

  This also solves problems with multiple-instance configurations...

- Fixes and enhancements to the Gather and Tree (Navigation Bar)
Interface...

- New Macro:

  GetCheckListItem(Index: 0..999, Reg: 0..9);

    Get a string associated with a specified item in the CheckBox
    interface.

- A bug with choosing the appearance of Bookmarks on XP has been
fixed.

- An elusive BUG with Backspace and Delete commands sometimes not
working if executed *immediately* after moving a caret to a new
position with a mouse has been fixed...

- ADVANCED: UNICODE Copy and Paste and Read/Write:

In Preferences| Advanced dialog you can specify the preferred format
(CODE PAGE) that should be used for advanced (UNICODE) clipboard
operations.

This data can also be specified with the following macros:

  SetClipboardPasteFormat("CP List");
  SetClipboardCopyFormat("CP");
  SetUnicodeCP("CP"); // affects Read and write of UNICODE files
  GetLastPasteCP(Reg: 0..9); // Last CP used for UNICODE Paste

Code Page can be specified for Clipboard and Read/Write UNICODE
conversion. The following Constants have a special meaning:

  _ACP     Windows ANSI Code Page   (CP_ACP)
  _OEMPCP  OEM (DOS) Code Page      (CP_OEMCP)
  _MACCP   MAC Code Page            (CP_MACCP)
  ACP      Current ANSI Code Page   (GETACP)
  OEMCP    Current OEM Code Page    (GETOEMCP)

If a non-empty string is specified then WinEdt requests clipboard
data in Unicode format (if available) and then performs a conversion
to specified code pages from left to right until it encounters CP
that allows the conversion without loss of data. For example, Paste
can use the following CP list:

  SetClipboardPasteFormat("ACP,OEMCP,1251");

    // First try the current code page, dos code page and finally
    // Cyrillic code page (see below for the list of CP codes)

Whether or not any such conversion is required depend on your
version of Windows and the way other applications use Windows
Clipboard. Of course in order for WinEdt to properly display the
text you have to use proper charset (font script). Check the help on
SetFontCharset(Value: 0..9999); macro function to see how to change
the font (some common scripts are available in the Options| Font
Menu). Unless you encounter problems with plain text copy and paste
operations you should avoid using UNICODE since it doubles the data
size and slows down the operation due to conversions. However, on
some systems (XP) you may have to use UNICODE format if you want to
exchange data containing more than 7-bit characters between
different applications.

For example (if required) one could have more than one Copy and
Paste commands. The following macros are examples:

  Copy as OEM
  SetClipboardCopyFormat("OEMCP");
  CMD("Copy");

  Paste as Greek
  SetClipboardPasteFormat("1253,ACP"); //just in case if text is NOT Greek
  CMD("Paste");

Not all of the CPs are available on all systems.

  65000 CP_UTF7  UTF-7 translation
  65001 CP_UTF8  UTF-8 translation

- Extended functionality for ListFolderFiles Macro:

 ListFolderFiles(Reg: 0..9,"Path", "filetype filter",
                 recurse_subfolders: 0..1, relative_path: 0..3, flags:0..111);

    Flags (from left to right):
      Include System Files   100
      Include Hidden Files   010
      Include Readonly Files 001

- Extended functionality for Beep Macro:

  Beep(#0..4,"Filename.wav");

 The second (optional) parameter can specify an existing AUDIO
 (*.wav) file to be played...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20020826 (v. 5.4)] (private build)
==================================================

- Extended CL <-> Index Macros...

- New Open and Save As dialogs on Win2000/XP...

- New XP-style appearance of dialogs and controls on WinXP.
  WinEdt now uses TMS Delphi package available at:

        http://www.tmssoftware.com/winxp.htm

    Another possibility to achieve this is to PATCH WinEdt.exe
    with Style-it XP utility available at:

        http://bootxp.net/styleitxp/

Thanks to Denis who directed me to the above web sites.

- a problem with assigning shortcuts to context popup menus that are
also linked to the right mouse response has been fixed.

- a few oddities and bugs (especially a serious problem with popup
menus) have been fixed in this build...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20020725 (v. 5.4)] (private build)
==================================================

- A (not commonly encountered but reproducible) problem with saving
the ini file has been fixed...

- A problem with corrupted or disappearing menu with
auto-configuration event handler has been eliminated (resource leak
has been fixed)...

- A bug with the "Idle Saving" option has been fixed...

- RegEx that compile in more than 255 RegEx instructions are now
handled properly.

- C-style errors are now detected with UNIX specification and they
allow drive specification for full filename.

- Compounded Words Option has been introduced for Dictionaries.
Compounded words can be highlighted with different attributes that
misspelled ones.

- An oddity with files reported as externally modified after a
switch to/ from daytime savings has been fixed: WinEdt now properly
handles UTC (Universal Time Coordinate) format...

- WinEdt Wizards are now centered with respect to the Main Form
(rather than desktop which caused problems on two monitors)...

- In WinEdt 5.4 it is possible to change Command, Utility, or
Document into a Macro without deleting the old menu item and
inserting a new macro. Just enter a new definition inside square
braces [...] and WinEdt will automatically change the item to macro.
I found it useful because in the long run all/ most menu items will
be eventually converted to macros...

- SetSort macro has an extra parameter:

 SetSort(Ascending,Case_Sensitive,Ignore_Length,Remove_Duplicates: #-1..1,
         Table: -7..8);

   Extra parameter for Tables (0..7): Table: -7..8

      0:      use the current table (whatever it may be)
      1..8:   use table x-1
      -7..-1: if current table is 7 (Dictionary) then use -x-1;

- Sorting of GDI Pages (Page directive now allows Sorting
Preferences):

 Page("Caption", "Mode Filter", "External File?", Case Insensitive: 0..1,
   Always Sorted: 0..1, Quick Sort: 0..1,
   Ascending,Case_Sensitive,Ignore_Length,Remove_Duplicates: -1..1,
   Table: -7..8);

Parameter for Tables has the same meaning as in SetSort.

The Page sorting preferences (if specified with non-defaults) also
reflect the initial preferences in the Sort Dialog displayed when
explicit Sort command in the interface is executed with Quick Sort
option disabled.

Furthermore, the context popup menu contains the option to enable or
disable Auto Sorting and Quick Sorting. This option changes the
properties of the current page for the duration of the current
WinEdt session. Permanent changes require modifications to
WinEdt.gdi...

- Prefix and Suffix may be specified as the last two parameters for
GDI Items. These two strings are a part of data displayed in the
gather list control... The TOC Page has been modified to take
advantage of the new functionality:

  //  Item('TeX','*',1,1,'\chapter?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','*',1,1,'\appendix?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','*',1,1,'\bibliography?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','*',1,1,'\nonumchapter?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','*',1,1,'\prefacesection?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','>>*',1,1,'\section?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','>>>>>>*',1,1,'\subsection?',0,1,1);
  //  Item('TeX','>>>>>>>>>>*',1,1,'\subsubsection?',0,1,1);
  Item('TeX','',1,1,'\chapter?{?}',0,1,1,'Chapter: ','');
  Item('TeX','',1,1,'\nonumchapter?{?}',0,1,1,'chapter: ','');
  Item('TeX','',1,1,'\appendix?{?}',0,1,1,'Appendix: ','');
  Item('TeX','',1,1,'\bibliography{?}',0,1,1,'Bibliography: ','');
  Item('TeX','',1,1,'\prefacesection?{?}',0,1,1,'Preface: ','');
  Item('TeX','>>',1,1,'\section?{?}',0,1,1,'Section: ','');
  Item('TeX','>>>>>>',1,1,'\subsection?{?}',0,1,1,'Subsection: ','');
  Item('TeX','>>>>>>>>>>',1,1,'\subsubsection?{?}',0,1,1,'subsection: ','');

 LoadSettings - parameter for extras (See the Macro Manual)
 ExtractSettings - parameter for extras (See the Macro Manual)

- New "Colors and Highlighting" interface. The Colors page has been
moved from Preferences Dialog to the new interface (previously
called just Syntax Highlighting). Also, the Background Page in the
appearance dialog has been removed and it is now replaced with a new
page, called Background Schemes, in the extended Colors and Syntax
Highlighting Dialog. It allows you to setup mode-dependent
background, left / right margin color schemes. Furthermore it is
possible to specify bitmaps for fancy tiled background effects
(should one feel less stressed writing on a piece of wood or on a
brick wall:-). Of course this means more import/ export macros and
modifications to the default settings...

First, there are two different schemes for Views A and B (view can
be toggled in the status line or Ctrl+Shift+=). The rule is as
follows:

The last selected scheme for a particular mode applies. By default
"A: Dots Blue" is enabled for EDT mode (eg. WinEdt Macros). You can
change the mode filter to empty or * and now it will apply to all
(primary view) documents except for any modes that are enabled after
this point in the list.

That's why it is best to put the "default" scheme to the top of the
list and then only overwrite those modes that you want...

*** Remember: The last enabled scheme always applies!!!

- New Import/Export Macros to cover Background Schemes:

  AddBackground("Filename");
  ExtractBackground("Filename");
  LoadBackground("Filename");

- Also:

  ExtractBookmarks("Filename");
  LoadBookmarks("Filename");

- New macros for process launching (execution):

  IfFinished("Then","Else");
  GetExitCode(Reg: 0..9);
  TerminateProcess;

These macros refer to the last process launched from WinEdt with
WinExe or Run macro. Use with care (TerminateProcess should be used
only for emergency and it may result in lost data or resources).

  WaitForMessage(timeout: 0..99999; Process_Messages: 0..1);

A custom Sync handler (after WinExe) should look like:

 Loop('IfFinished("GetExitCode(0);Stop;","WaitForMessage(10,1);");');

Without WaitForMessage call WinEdt would compete with the running
process for CPU in a tight loop (thus making the compilation much
slower)!

- New Macros (or symmetry reason):

  SetEnvVar <-> GetEnvVar

(even if one will mostly use %@();)

  ReadFile <-> WriteFile

(dump a register in one step)

  WriteFile("Filename","String");
  GetEnvVar(Reg: 0..9,"VAR");

- New Parameter for EOLN format for WrL macro:

WrL("String",EOLN: -1..3);

  EOLN: 0 - Default=CR+LF
        1 - UNIX=LF
        2 - VMS=CR
        3 - Exotic=LF+CR
       -1 - Current Document

Note that before -1 (Current Document's EOLN format) was the default
which does not make much sense...

- New Macros to manipulate/ navigate Strings:

  GetDocEOLNFormat(Reg: 0..9);
  SetDocEOLNFormat(EOLN: 0..3);
  GetStrEOLNFormat(Reg: 0..9, "String");
  SetStrEOLNFormat(EOLN: 0..3, "String", Output Register: 0..9);

  EOLN: 0 - Default=CR+LF
        1 - UNIX=LF
        2 - VMS=CR
        3 - Exotic=LF+CR

  MoveBy(chars:-999999999..999999999, useCLStart:0..1, eoln_length: 0..2);
    Move by a specified number of characters in the current
    document (left or right depending on the the parameter chars
    being negative or positive, respectively).

  SetCLStart(flag: 0..2, eoln_length: 0..2);
    flag 0 = beginning of the document
         1 = selected portion (or block)
         2 = current position
    Sets the parameters for Index <-> Line Column functions

  IndexToCL(index, regC, regL, "String");
    This function returns 1-based Column and Line of the text
    corresponding to the given Index in a 0-based string extracted
    from the text...

    If the optional String Parameter is omitted then the current
    file is used. SetCLStart is only used for the current document...

    An Example:
    ===========

      // A portion of text is selected
      LetReg(0,"%S"); // Get Selected Text
      SetCLStart(1);  // Remember where the string came from...
      // Pass the string %!0 to some external application which finds
      // the index of the position you are interested in...
      // Store the index in register 1
      // Go to that Position in your document
      IndexToCL(%!1, 2,3);
      GotoCL(%!2,%!3);

  CLToIndex(c,l, reg, "String");
    The inverse of IndexToCL();

-New macros to change or obtain the font script:

   SetFontCharset(Value: 0..9999);
   GetFontCharset(Reg: 0..9);

- New macro for WordWeb (Thesaurus):

    WordWebLookup(Reg: 0..9,"Word",CloseonCopy: 0..1);

    Requires WordWeb installed. Free download is available at:

        http://wordweb.info/free/

   WinEdt macro function to check and possibly replace a word (after
   copying a word in WordWeb interface [eg. pressing on a Copy
   button or using a shortcut Alt+C]) can be defined as:

   SelWord(1);WordWebLookup(0,"%S",1);
   IfOK(!'BeginGroup;CMD("Delete");Ins("%!0");EndGroup;');

  For more information on how to use and configure WordWeb consult
  its own Help...

- A new Option (Preferences| Shell) for Custom Scroll Wheel response
when the mouse pointer is placed on Document Tabs (Next and
Previous)

- GUI Control and Toolbar now implements scrolling if WinEdt Window
is resized so as to hide a portion of the GUI control...

- A new option for Backup of Project files.

- New Options for soft wrapping (currently no interface????)
    Format on Resize (true){}{}{}
    Proper Line Numbers    (true)
    Use Bold Attribute     (false)

- Reduced/ eliminated flickering on XP when switching between
maximized documents by using the Tab control.

- WinEdt now implements concurrent license monitor which was
requested by quite a few administrators on larger networks.

WinEdt's Site Licenses and Subscription License limit the number of
concurrently running instances of WinEdt on a network to a specified
number of users. When the quota is reached no more instances can be
started until another instance of WinEdt is closed. An attempt to
start another instance results in the following message:

  Licensed quota of concurrently running instances of WinEdt is exceeded.
  Try again later or contact your system administrator about this message!

This functionality ensures that the use of the program on networks
complies with the licensing agreement.

WinEdt's Shell Configuration Wizard allows the administrator to
monitor the usage of WinEdt on a network. WinEdt also produces a
minute by minute log file detailing a usage of the program on a
network. This data can be used should a need to upgrade a license
arise...

If you encounter any problems with this functionality contact WinEdt
Team at: support@WinEdt.com.

______________________________________________________________________________


WinEdt 5 [Build 20020323 (v. 5.3)] (official release)
=====================================================

After the installation is finished WinEdt displays a
(consolidated) Configuration Wizard allowing you to quickly
configure basic aspects of WinEdt and its integration with Windows
and TeX. The Wizard keeps on appearing until the option "Show this
Wizard next time" at the bottom of the dialog is unchecked. Later
it can be started from the Options Menu... Check it out!!!

The TeX Configuration Wizard is now implemented and documented for
MiKTeX, fpTeX (web2c) and YandY TeX.


  - More robust Backup and Restore macros to better preserve
  custom settings. User profile is upgraded with new files as
  required...

  - Minor fixes (a few typos in the documentation) and a few
  enhancements to the default interfaces (context sensitive help
  in popup menu)...

  - Slightly improved EOLN format handling when the document mode
  is changed...

  - Minor improvements when it comes to handling relative file
  specifications in the Project Tree...

  - WinEdt now properly installs or upgrades itself even if
  the previous instance was using user profiles (the defaults are
  the proper defaults that come with the new version)...

  - The Default Settings have now been stripped of all Alt+Ctrl
  (AltGr) shortcuts to avoid (too) many conflicts with different
  keyboards...

  - A bug with RegEx A**C has been fixed...

  - An oddity with overwriting a Selected Column (Block Mode) has
  been fixed.

  - A new shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E is (by default) used to Hide the
  Errors interface.

  - \OE and \oe have been added to the default Read and Write
  Translation Tables...

  - Help has been updated with the new Menu and Shortcuts Scheme
  (minor modifications mostly pertaining to Ctrl+Alt).


WinEdt 5 [Build 20020317 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - Improved and extended Help, (Illustrated) Users Manual, Macro
  Manual and Documentation. See WinEdt's Help -> WinEdt
  Documentation Menu. CHECK IT OUT!

  - Doc Menu now contains a short LaTeX demo (graphics inclusion,
  colors, international characters, rotated tables and some useful
  TeX-ing advices and hints (7 pages).

  - A few shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+[Shift]=) have been eliminated from
  the default setup to avoid conflicts with certain keyboards
  (French, Italian, Swedish)...

   - Wildcard "*" in strings is limited to one
  line to make the search in strings more compatible with the
  search in text. Use "**" if you want the search scope spanned
  over line terminators...

  - A few fixes and enhancements to the default Insert Menu.

  - A new parameter to suppress warning if the application is not
  running and it is not (properly) specified. Use IfOK after the
  macro to check the status of the execution:

   DDEOpen("Server Application","Service","Topic",Suppress_Warning:0..1);

  - A minor enhancements to the Block (Column) Delete operation...

  - Standard (ASCII) Wrapping Extension:

    By default (See Settings Dialog: Comments) WinEdt uses %% as a
    Hard Return when Standard ASCII Wrapping is enabled for TeX
    Mode. In the default settings "Shift+Ctrl+Enter" is assigned
    to the macro that in TeX Mode inserts %%+<line terminator>.
    Under some circumstances this strategy can ensure simple and
    efficient wrapping in your TeX documents (without restoring to
    "Conventional (Soft) Wrapping")... You should take advantage
    of this functionality is you want to enable wrapping for
    indented environments (which can be handy if you want nicely
    auto-formatted itemized environments). Hard returns may be
    required inside equations or tables to prevent WinEdt from
    re-formatting such environments as if they were plain text...

  - A better recovery should the WinEdt.ini file get corrupted
  (if possible a backup or else the default is automatically loaded).

  - Locale (language) specification for GetDate:

    GetDate(StrRegister: 0..9, "Format", "Locale");
      This macro provides an interface to FormatDateTime function.
      The function takes current date and time and formats it as
      specified by the user in the "Format" parameter. The results is
      available in the local register %!0..%!9. If the Optional
      "Format" parameter is omitted or left empty then the function
      returns the previous value which (in English) is equivalent to
      the format:

          'dddd, mmmm d, yyyy "at" hh:nn'

          Tuesday, September 1, 1998 at 16:49

     The following is produced with 'dddd, mmmm d, yyyy' and
     Locale specified as:
          dimarts, mar 12, 2002          Catalan
          Tuesday, March 12, 2002         English
          mardi, mars 12, 2002            French
          Dienstag, Mrz 12, 2002         German
          marted, marzo 12, 2002         Italian
          torek, marec 12, 2002           Slovenian
          Martes, Marzo 12, 2002          Spanish

     Note that it is up to your Windows Language Support to properly
     format the string according to the specified language's
     rules...

  - FormatString(); function now has an extra formatting command
  "capitals" to convert the initial capitals...

  - A few minor selection refresh oddities have been fixed...

WinEdt 5 [Build 20020219 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - The Bookmarks Menu has been restored back to the default
  Ctrl+Shift+0..9 scheme to avoid problems with some keyboards
  that use Ctrl+Alt 0..9 for {,}, etc...

     Popup Menus are now defined as:
     ===============================
        Grave                       Ctrl+`  (Invisible)
        Acute                       Ctrl+'  (Invisible)
        Umlaut                      Shift+Ctrl+'  (Invisible)
        Tilde                       Shift+Ctrl+`  (Invisible)
        Circumflex                  Alt+Shift+Ctrl+6  (Invisible)

     Thus Ctrl+` followed by a character "a" produces "", etc...
     This works with Western fonts!

    This is final solution for the default settings: I cannot
    please everyone and the conflict between Set Bookmark 6 and
    Circumflex in the default settings has to be resolved! If you
    have a problem with this scheme change your settings through
    the Options -> Menu Setup Dialog. For example go to the Popup
    Menus Tab Page and change the shortcut to Circumflex to a
    keystroke of your choice (it used to be Shift+Ctrl+6).

  - A few minor oddities in the Insert Menu have been fixed.

  - Improved Insert and Remove  Comment Commands (Ctrl+Alt+Shift
  Left or Right).

  - The bullet character (ASCII 127) is now translated to
  highlighted (red+Bold) "*" in the Screen Translation Table.
  This makes bullets visible in non-Western version of Windows
  (with different fonts and encodings)... The translation and
  highlighting attributes  can be changed in the Settings:
  Translations dialog and Highlighting| Filter Set dialog,
  respectively.

  - TeX Live 6 detection has been improved in the TeX System Macro.

  - Oddity with the TeX Configuration Wizard in YandY
  Configuration has been fixed...

  - To avoid confusion with Filetype Associations and Projects the
  filetype associations are now done without -V command switch...
  This can be customized (on per-filetype basis by editing the
  "...WinShell\Create WinEdt Filetypes.edt" macro script: Change
  the value assigned to Register 7):

    // Command Line Switches:
    // Affects the first instance of WinEdt
    // -V: Temporary Project
    // -0: Don't restore other documents
    // Empty: default...
    // Can be customized on per-filetype basis:
    //        Search for %!7 or %$('WinEdt-Exe');
    //        and add, remove or change the switch
    LetReg(7,'');  // Default Command Switch: None

  - Improved Combo box for the list interface (minor enhancement).

  - Additional bitmaps for Toolbar and Menu (mostly for XML Mode)...

--------------------------

  - Yet another bug with Optimized RegEx has been fixed:
    ">" in Softly Wrapped documents...

  - The Document Settings Dialog now displays the time when the
  file was last modified, Created or accessed...

  - A few enhancements to the macros and a few minor (bug) fixes
  have been implemented... Error Search has been further improved
  to filter out more Warnings in c-style error log file...

  - An (optional) alternative mode for bookmarks has been
  introduced: Floating Bookmarks mode always links the current
  bookmark to the current cursor (caret) position. The Appearance
  dialog has been modified to allow a selection of Standard or
  Floating Bookmark mode. Furthermore, for visual effect the
  appearance of the current bookmark can be selected to be
  different from others. Floating bookmarks closely resemble
  multiple instances of the same document.

  To avoid messing up the current position when text is being
  positioned through the tracking in the Gather interface or Error
  Search it is possible to set Zero as a "roaming" bookmark. With
  this option SetBookMark(0); (by default Ctrl+Alt+0) macro is
  always executed before any of the above interfaces resets the
  position in your document. Thus GOTOBookMark(0); (by default
  Ctrl+0) in the Standard mode brings you back to your last
  working position while in the floating bookmarks it prevents
  your last (proper/non-roaming) bookmark to be reset. Note that
  with this option enabled 0 should not be used as a real bookmark
  since it can get reset. With "roaming" approach it makes sense
  to define an inverse search as:

    WinEdt.exe -F "[SetBookMark('0');Open(|%f|);SelPar(%l,8)]"

  depending on whether or not you want your current bookmark reset
  to the new position when you initiate an inverse DVI Search from
  the previewer (such as YAP).

  Note that in the Floating Bookmark mode you can never erase the
  current bookmark. The context popup menu (displayed in response
  to the right mouse-click on the left margin) has been
  enhanced with context-sensitive bookmark commands...

  In addition to bookmarks, the status line contains the panel
  displaying A and B which can be used to switch between two
  different positions in the current document. Bookmarks and
  alternative position are preserved for the next session (they
  are part of the file attributes in the project list).

    Note that (by default) Ctrl+[Shift+]Backspace still moves you
    back (or forward) in the "ring" of recent positions in your
    document and Alt+Backspace [or Ctrl+Z] (initiates the undo)
    positions you to the place of the last change before undoing
    it with the next undo command. This, too, can come handy when
    navigating through large documents...

  Users that don't care for bookmarks may still choose the
  Floating Bookmarks since the left margin provides a useful
  visual effect pointing to the current line in a document.

  - To avoid the conflict with shortcuts to the Invisible Popup
  Menus for international characters the Circumflex Popup
  menu shortcut has been modified from Ctrl+Shift+6 to
  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0..9

    Popup Menus:
    ============
       Grave                       Ctrl+`  (Invisible)
       Acute                       Ctrl+'  (Invisible)
       Umlaut                      Shift+Ctrl+'  (Invisible)
       Tilde                       Shift+Ctrl+`  (Invisible)
       Circumflex                  Alt+Shift+Ctrl+6  (Invisible)

    Thus Ctrl+` followed by a character "a" produces "", etc...
    This works with Western fonts!

  This eliminates the conflict between the default shortcuts
  (Popup Menus have a priority over ordinary menu items). If you
  prefer some other scheme for Bookmarks you have to modify
  shortcuts in the Bookmarks Menu in the Menu Setup Dialog.
  However, note that in this case the shortcut to Circumflex
  disables the default shortcut to set the bookmark 6. Bookmarks
  can also be accessed through the double-shortcuts (Alt+=). You
  can check the Shortcut List and Menu Listing Tab in the Menu
  Setup Dialog for the list of all shortcuts and menus...

    Hint: the list can be copied and pasted into WinEdt and then
    printed for a quick reference.


WinEdt 5 [Build 20020127 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - A refresh oddity with bookmarks has been fixed (auto wrapping).
  Bookmarks now "float" better when a paragraph is re-formatted...

  - TeX Configuration Macros have been fixed so as to allow easy
  switching between MiKTeX, fpTeX (web2c) and YandY TeX
  implementations. It has been tested with all configurations:
  the trick is that WinEdt inserts the binary folder of the
  current configuration in front of the PATH. As a consequence
  WinEdt Options -> Configurations Menu now contains two entries:

    Startup.edt where variables independent of the TeX system are
    initialized (GS, GSView, Acrobat [Reader])...

    TeX System.edt where variables specific to the current TeX
    System are initialized...

  For most users this should happen transparently (the default
  macros take care of everything). However, advanced users can now
  use more than one TeX system and switch between them at their
  convenience by executing the appropriate Configuration command
  in the Options -> Configurations Menu...

  - WinEdt's customizable menu was designed without taking into
  consideration a possibility of switching between configurations
  depending on the mode of a document or a temporary choice of a
  TeX system. Such extensions came to life later and the current
  mechanism is too static to handle them. Changing a shortcut for
  LaTeX in such settings becomes a nightmare (after the change is
  made in the Menu Setup one also has to manually update the
  configuration menu [eg. Config\MiKTeX]). Neglecting to update the
  configuration(s) would result in the loss of custom shortcuts
  after switching between different configurations... (at the
  moment MiKTeX, fpTeX, YandY TeX, HTML and ASCII configurations
  are included in the default settings while others [Perl,
  Fortran, Java, C, ...] are available from an ever growing
  collection at www.winedt.org).

    The Options -> Configurations menu now has a Maintenance
    Utility (macro) called "Update Configurations...". It can be
    used to apply the current settings (or a part of them) to any
    of the pre-defined configurations. Macro is rather
    sophisticated and it offers suitable choices (eg. common LaTeX
    Insert Menu for all TeX Configurations). It also disables
    components that are already updated thus providing a useful
    visual feedback. Furthermore, the macros to load
    configurations have been revisited and they can and do use a
    private copy of the configuration (%b - User Profile) if one
    is available. Private copies are automatically generated with
    the Maintenance Macro...

      The macro is sophisticated enough that it can extract,
      compare and update individual menus in the single Menu.dat
      file. Users that want to use configurations and also want to
      customize re-loadable [configuration-sensitive] menus
      (Insert, Accessories and Help) have to run the "Update
      Configurations..." Macro after their customizations to
      export the modified menus into the appropriate configuration
      components.

  - A new macro has been implemented:

     SortLines("Source String",Flags:0..1111,Table: 0..7,Result:0..9);

      Flags (from left to right):
          1000 Remove Multiple
          100  Ignore Length
          10   Case Sensitive
          1    Ascending

    It works regardless of the format (CR+LF or LF).

  - SearchInString function has been optimized (huge difference in
  large strings with non case-sensitive search).

  - A bug with backward search in selected strings has been
  fixed.

  - Document Settings Dialog now displays times when the file was
  last modified (created and accessed)...

  - Error Search dialog now has an "up/down" button which can be
  used to enable or prevent search for Warnings with the commands
  in Error's Dialogs Toolbar (Next and Previous Error). Warnings
  (TeX errors of type 2-4) are enabled only when this button is
  down.

  - Modified macro IfLogErrors and a new macro FindError have been
  implemented to make error recovery in background mode
  compilation more useful... The default macro scripts have been
  modified with new parameters:

     IfLogErrors("Then","Else", c-style: -1..1,
                 type1,type2,type3,type4: -1..1, type_1_filter: 0..9);
       Used for Error Log file parsing and the execution flow
       control in compilation macros...
        c-style:    -1 OFF
                     0 Default (depending on Error Settings)
                     1 ON
        type1-4:    -1 OFF
                     0 only if the Warnings "button" is down
                     1 ON (if enabled type 1..4 in Error Settings)
        type_1_filter: 0 - OFF
                       n - if the RegEx string "<!* warning*:"
                           is found within n lines backward then the
                           error is downgraded to a type 4 warning.
                           This helps filtering out some warnings...
                           (eg. PDFTeX Type 1 Warnings).

     FindError(Initialize:-1..1, Direction: -1..1, c-style: -1..1,
               type1,type2,type3,type4: -1..1, type_1_filter: 0..9);
        Initialize: -1 - NEVER (keep current log file as loaded)
                     0 - UPDATE Log file if necessary and then
                         search for errors
                     1 - UPDATE Log file if necessary and
                         stay at the beginning if the file has changed
                         (suppress searching for next error)
        Direction:  -1 - previous error
                     0 - stay where you are
                     1 - next error
        c-style:    -1 OFF
                     0 Default (depending on Error Settings)
                     1 ON
        type1-4:    -1 OFF
                     0 only if the Warnings "button" is down
                     1 ON (if enabled type 1..4 in Error Settings)
        type_1_filter: 0 - OFF
                       n - if the RegEx string "<!* warning*:"
                           is found within n lines backward then the
                           error is downgraded to a type 4 warning.
                           This helps filtering out some warnings...
                           (eg. PDFTeX Type 1 Warnings).

  - Extended macro (added parameter "Selected String"):

    ShowList(DblClickExecute:0|1,DblClickClose:0|1,"OK Macro","Cancel Macro",
             Selected_Item: 0..999999999,"Selected String");

  - Enhancements to the macro GetColor:

    GetColor(Register: 0..9, "InitialColor", RGB_Format: 0..3, "Delimiter");

    // RGB: 0 = HEX FF0000 (Red)
    //      1 = DEC 255 0 0 (Red)
    //      2 = PERCENT 100 0 0 (Red)
    //      3 = Fraction 1.00,0.00,0.00 (Red)
    //
    //    Color Delimiter has to be entered for 1..3:
    //    in our example '',' ' and ',' are specified as RGB delimiters

   This should make it possible to define Active Strings for
   double-clicking on

        \textcolor[RGB]{?}
     or
        COLOR="#?"

  - Environment Completion Active Strings are now defined as follows:

    \begin{?}>
    triggers ChangeEnv macro.

    \begin{?}}
    triggers CompleteEnv macro.

    \end{{
    triggers completion (backward).

  - More RegEx oddities have been fixed:-(

  - Minor problems with scroll bar position when switching between
  instances have been fixed.

  - New Macro

      GetDocAsASCII(Register:0..9, "Filename", Translate: -1..1, EOLN: 0..4);

    Store the result in specified register.

    If Filename is empty (or the file is not currently opened)
    then the current document is exported.

    The Write translation is applied depending on the value of the
    Translate Parameter (-1=off, 0=default, 1=on).

    The line terminator can be specified as follows:
        0: Default (usually CR+LF unless otherwise specified or imported)
        1: CR+LF (Windows/DOS)
        2: LF (UNIX)
        3: CR (VMS)
        4: LF+CR

      This macro can come handy if you want to export Softly
      Wrapped document as an ASCII file (reflecting the currently
      wrapped lines). For Example:

        // Get Main File or Current Document in Register 0
        GetDocAsASCII(0,'%F');
        // Save as *.tek
        OpenOutput('%P\%N.tek');
        WrS('%!0');
        CloseOutput;

          etc...

  - The following macros now allow default value parameters.
    %!? or %!x,%!y and %!z (respectively):
        GetLongString("Prompt","Caption","Default Value");
        GetString("Prompt","Caption","Default Value");
        GetDim("Label1","Label2","Caption","x","y");
        GetCounter("Label","Caption","z");

  - Binary Mode now supports Wrapping and Formatting in blocks of
  binary data (not extensively tested and rarely used: WinEdt is
  not designed as a binary or HEX editor!!!)...

  - A long list of minor enhancements and fixes (mostly of
  "look-and-feel" nature)...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20011213 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - The Configuration Wizards have been consolidated: Shell and
  TeX Configuration Wizard can now be started from within the
  WinEdt Configuration Wizard (which is placed in the Options
  Menu). WinEdt is initially started with the Configuration Wizard
  Displayed and until the Option "Show this Wizard next time" at
  the bottom of the Wizard is unchecked the Wizard remains active
  on subsequent launches of the program.

  - TeX configuration Wizard has been simplified (it contains
  less checkboxes for Customization of the Execution Mode).

  - Project Menu has been split into Document and Project Menus to
  distinguish between settings pertaining to current document
  from the project manger commands...

  - Tool bar contains a few new buttons (an interface to
  frequently requested [font] commands).

  - WinEdt can now load UNICODE files. However, this does not
  imply that they can be edited as such. WinEdt converts them to
  ASCII and can convert them back to UNICODE when they are saved.
  This can result in loss of characters that are not available in
  the current ANSI Code Page. WinEdt warns you if this is the
  case. However, many UNICODE files are just inflated ASCII files
  and this extension enables WinEdt to handle such files as if
  they were ASCII. Document Settings Dialog now contains an extra
  control that displays the ANSI/UNICODE format of a document.

  - The menu items Insert and Remove Comment (in Edit| Move Menu)
  now properly handle HTML Mode [they were converted to macros].
  Also in the default settings delimiter matching for <...> is
  enabled in HTML mode.

  - Active String \begin{?}> for TeX mode has been associated with
  a macro (based on Robert's ChangeEnv.edt) which does the
  following:

    if the closing \end environment is found it prompts you to
    change the environment name otherwise it completes the current
    environment (nice).

  - Improved highlighting for citations: \cite[...]{...}

  - Some Macros in the WinShell folder have been slightly
  improved and the information in the Shell Configuration Wizard
  has been simplified.

  - A bug with double-quotes inside strings have been fixed...

  - Backup and Auto Save now allows specification of backup files
  in folders that don't necessary exist. The Option Create folder
  if needed should be used to force WinEdt to create a folder.
  Also a prefix # (for filenames and path specifications) has been
  introduces to extract a unique path:

    for %P = C:\WinEdt\Doc

    %#P = C\WinEdt\Doc

  This makes it possible to specify C:\My Backups\%#P\%N.bak
  for global backup folder, etc... This works with UNC filenames
  as well (\\Server\...).

  - Requires File functionality affects the launch of compilers
  for new documents. Since many users find this behavior
  contra-intuitive (eg. a disabled LaTeX button is often taken as
  an indicator that WinEdt cannot find latex.exe) I've now decided
  to extend this functionality in a way that should cover more
  preferences.

  The default "Requires File" filed for LaTeX now reads:

      "%!M=TeX"

  As long as the current document (or the main file when set) has
  mode TeX[:submodes], the menu item is enabled. This can be
  combined with the rest of the menu item filters, eg.

      "%!M=TeX"?<%F>%P\%N.tex?<%F>%P\%N.texi

  This restores and enhances the "old" behavior in the sense that
  the document mode (rather than an extension) determines whether
  TeX compiler is enabled (and this applies to new documents as
  well). For dvips, DVI Preview, or dvi2pdf, the existence of the
  dvi file remains a "good" filter since all of the above actions
  will fail if the dvi source does not exist. But of course, it all
  boils down to the personal preferences and taste (simple vs.
  "smart" configuration).

  - WinEdt suffered from a bug in Delphi's VCL: when WinEdt
  Windows was tiled or cascaded an extra ghost Window was taken
  into consideration thus preventing WinEdt from being properly
  tiled with a previewer. After a long investigation the problem
  has now been fixed in my private VCL unit.

  - The input directives in the Preferences| Input dialog now
  allow specification with multiple parameters, such as

    \MYINCLUDE[?]{?}{?}

  the last parameter is considered to be the filename and the rest
  is ignored...

  - A bug with Remove Comment command with comments larger than
  one character have been fixed.

  - OpenOutput macro now correctly interprets the meaning of the
  Append parameter.

  - The default Macro Scripts for launching pdf-creating
  accessories have been improved to make sure that Acrobat Reader
  releases a document before the compilation starts.

  - Settings | Matching Dialog now has an extra parameter Timeout
  which can be used to specify the timeout (in milliseconds) for
  automatic matching of delimiters. In huge documents typing { at
  the beginning could result in a noticeable delay of 5-10 seconds,
  which is not acceptable for the automatic delimiter matching
  functionality...

  - A new Macro

    GetColor(Reg: 0..9,InitialColor: String);

  can be used to display the Common Colors Dialog and return the
  HEX RGB value of the selected color in the specified Register.
  Use IfOK function to see if the dialog was properly
  terminated... The color is specified as a 6-digit HEX RGB value.

  - Regular Expressions: a bug with the Optimized Regular
  Expressions has been fixed. The Option in the Context Popup
  Menu in the Find Dialog remains until this is confirmed. A few
  other RegEx oddities have been fixed as well..

  - Regular Expressions: The Character # now has an ordinary
  meaning. \# has to be used for a filter.

    RegEx - New in WinEdt 5.3:
    ==========================

    ** stands for a wildcard that is not limited to one line
       it can come handy but it has to be used with care in large
       documents (especially with tags it can get slow!!!)

       a single * has the same meaning as before...

    \#{Expression}

    or

    \#~{Expression}

    can be used as filters in front of the next expression. The filter
    is calculated (backward) after the match to the next expression
    has been found and the filter is limited to one line (the
    beginning of the line in which the expression has been found -
    even if the line is only softly wrapped). The control sequence \#
    is being used instead of # to avoid compatibility problems with
    older RegEx (# was and remains an admissible (ordinary) character
    in strings).

      Examples:

      \#{\\}label

      all labels that are preceded by \ (\ is not a part of the match).

      \#~{\\}label

      all labels that are not preceded by \ (\ is not a part of the
      match).

      and

      \#~{\\\\}#{\\}label

      all labels that are preceded by \ but not \\...

      This can come handy and can significantly simplify the current
      method of handling such cases.

      Note that for a similar filter at the end of the expression one
      can use ~ (negative) or ~~ (positive).


WinEdt 5 [Build 20010815 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - The default menu no no longer contains any documents or
  utilities. The macros Open and Run are used, instead. If you
  make modifications you should probably observe this practice
  which will make your configurations easier to upgrade or enhance
  (should the need for more sophisticated application launching of
  some accessory arise in the future, as it often does!).

  - The new Shell Configuration Wizard makes the following tasks
  easy and gives users choices when it comes to the integration of
  WinEdt with their Windows:

    -- Create Links and Shortcuts to WinEdt
    -- Filetype associations
    -- User profiles Creation and configuration
    -- Uninstalling

  In the default settings the Macro Menu Item: ShellWizard; is
  placed at the bottom of the Options Menu...

  The Wizard uses a series of WinEdt macros in WinShell folder.
  Since User Profiles are a reality on Win2000 systems (many users
  prefer to work without administrative privileges even if they
  are the sole users of the machine) the information no longer
  belongs to the Network folder but is now stored in the
  WinShell\Profiles folder. Creation of User Profiles is fully
  automated and WinEdt's Wizard explains a few basic concepts for
  users that don't know anything about it...

    New Macro:

      ShellWizard("Caption");

  - WinEdt's "Configuration Wizard" in the Help Menu now only
  deals with Editor related issues (Wrapping, Project Manager,
  Application Launching, etc...). TeX- related issues are
  addressed in the new TeX Configuration Wizard that is placed in
  the Accessories menu and contains information specific to the
  selected TeX system (eg. MiKTeX, fpTeX or YandY TeX).

    New Macro:

      WinEdtWizard("Caption");

 - The new TeX Configuration Wizard is placed in the Accessories
 Menu and contains TeX system specific information and diagnostic
 utility.

 [TeXWizard('*** WinEdt MiKTeX Configuration Wizard',
            '%B\Doc\Wizard-MiKTeX','%B\Exec\MiKTeX',
            '%b\Exec',1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,'%b\Exec\MiKTeX');]

  The following macro has been implemented to cover different
  TeX system Wizards:

    TeXWizard("Caption","Doc folder containing .rtf files",
      "The folder where TeX system specific configuration is stored",
      "The folder where the current TeX system configuration is stored",
       Custom_Configuration: 0..1,
       BATCH_Configuration: 0..1,
       Direct_Configuration: 0..1,
       Background_Configuration: 0..1,
       Detached_Configuration: 0..1,
       isMiKTeX: 0..1,
       isfpTeX: 0..1,
       isYandYTeX: 0..1,
      "The folder where the local TeX system configuration is stored");

    Note that the Doc Folder has to contain .rtf files that
    are displayed in the Wizard's .rtf control(s).

    The rest depends on the state of configuration and execution
    macros for the selected TeX system.

  For more information consult the macros in WinEdt's Exec\MikTeX
  folder. In particular, the macro TeXConfig.edt contains your
  selections pertaining to the execution mode and the macro Create
  TeX Configuration.edt provides a GUI for custom execution mode...
  The Startup macro executes TeXConfig.edt in Exec folder.

  The macro may appear complicated but it was prepared with
  differen preferences and different TeX systems in mind...

  Currently only MiKTeX configuration contains the Wizard and it
  uses a series of macro scripts in WinEdt WinEdt's Exec to launch
  MiKTeX's executables. The macros in Exec folder have been
  rewritten and now take into consideration many options that can
  be determined in the above Wizard...

  I will shortly prepare a similar setup for fpTeX and YandY TeX.
  For now they use the old configuration (Options->Configurations
  Menu). For now I'll wait for feedback regarding the new MiKTeX
  configuration...

    fpTeX and YandY TeX do not offer any Wizard or additional
    Configuration options at this stage...

  - New Macro for HTML Help:

    HTMLHelp("Help File.chm", Main_Window_is_the_Owner: 0..1,
             Mode: 0..5, "Keyword or Link", Get_Keyword: 0..1);

    If Main Window is the Owner WinEdt cannot be used until the
    Help Window is closed. Otherwise you can minimize the Help
    Window and continue to use WinEdt (the HTML Help Window is in
    Windows Task bar).

    Mode determines how is the HTML Windows called:

      0: HH_DISPLAY_TOPIC
      1: HH_DISPLAY_TOC
      2: HH_DISPLAY_INDEX
      3: HH_DISPLAY_SEARCH
      4: HH_KEYWORD_LOOKUP
      5: HH_ALINK_LOOKUP

    Keyword or Link can be passed in Modes 4 and 5, respectively.

    Get_Keyword parameter instructs WinEdt to pass the currently
    selected string as a keyword. It can come handy if you are
    using MiKTeX's Help for LaTeX which is defined in WinEdt's
    Menu as the following macro:

      HTMLHelp("%$('TeX-Root');\doc\latex\help\latex2e.chm",0,4,"",1);

    It is enabled only if the .chm file exists (should be the case
    in MiKTeX 2.1). If no word is selected WinEdt passes the
    current word or TeX command...

  If you need more information read MS documentation for HTML Help
  systems (the above macro is an interface to Windows API)...

  - The default settings use MiKTeX's HTML Help files (*.chm) which
  in  MiKTeX 2.1 replace the older WinHelp (*.hlp) files.

  - New Macro(s) for Self-Installation Script(s):

     CreateLink("Destination", "Link Name", "File Path and Name",
                "Arguments", "Working Directory", "Description",
                "Icon Path", "Icon Index");

    For more information consult the macro

      WinShell\Create WinEdt Links.edt

    Where this macro is being put to the test...

      GetBuild(Reg: 0..9);
      GetVersion(Reg: 0..9);
      GetCaption(Reg: 0..9);

    Store WinEdt's Version information in the specified register.

  - New Macro(s) to manipulate a special dialog interface used
  for WinEdt's Icons and Filetype associations (eg. from the Shell
  Configuration Wizard):

    ClearIconList;
    ShowIconList("Caption");
    IfIconChecked(Index: 0..999, Level: 0..2,"Then Macro","Else Macro");
    AddIconItem(Checked: 0..1, OpenWith_Checked: 0..1, UseIcon_Checked: 0..1,
      "Extension (eg. .tex)", "Description Extension (eg. TeX Document)",
      "Open_IconFilename.ico", "Explorer_IconFile",
      xChecked: 0..1, xOpenWith_Checked: 0..1, xUseIcon_Checked: 0..1);

    The last three optional parameters are used if no Item in the
    interface is checked. This comes handy, when the interface is
    called for the first time (nothing is associated with WinEdt)
    to provide the user with suitable defaults (rather than all
    items being unchecked).

    The dialog interface is slightly more complicated because it
    allows you to independently choose if WinEdt should open the
    files and if the assigned icon should be used in the explorer
    (that's why there are three levels 0..2 in the IfIconChecked
    macro).

    For more information consult the macro

      WinShell\Create WinEdt Filetypes.edt

    Where this interface is being put to the test...

    The Macro

      OpenIcons(",",",",",",");

    is no longer there as it has been replaced with the above
    interface that relies on WinEdt's Macro language rather than
    Windows ability to properly execute the .inf scripts...

  - New Macro

   IfFileLocked("Filename",flags:00000..11111,
     "Locked Macro","not Locked Macro","does not exist Macro");

     Executes one of the three specified macros depending on the
     Status of file.

     Flags from left to right:

       Sharing:
         FILE_SHARE_DELETE
         FILE_SHARE_WRITE
         FILE_SHARE_READ

       Access:
         GENERIC_WRITE
         GENERIC_READ

   Used in the new and enhanced PDF macros to solve the problem
   with Acrobat locking the PDF files...

 - New Macro RunPrompt

     RunPrompt("Caption", isMacro: 0..1, isCustomFont: 0..1,
                isEmpty: 0..1; EraseList: 0..1);

   It is used in the "Accessories| Run" and "Macros| Define and Run
   Macro" Menu Items. It maintains a drop-down list of recently
   executed accessories and macros...

 - The macro OpenOutput now has an extra parameter Append: 0..1

    OpenOutput("File Name", Append: 0..1);

 - The macro AddCheckList now has an extra parameter Enabled: 0..1

   AddCheckList("Check Box Caption", Checked: 0..1, Enabled: 0..1);
     Add a new item to the list. Up to 999 items are admissible.

 - The macro Open(...) now has extra parameters:

    Open("Document Name", Readonly:-1..1, Update: -1..1, "Document Mode",
                          SetFolder: -1..1, Main: 0..1);

 - the last parameter of the Registry Key Query function has an
 extended meaning:

   ' '   - Get the Default Key Value (as before)
   '  '  - Get the First Subkey Name
   '   ' - Get the Last  Subkey Name

 This should address the automatic detection of future versions of
 Ghostscript in Startup.etd. The code is now modified as follows:

  // Get AFPL Ghostscript from Windows Registry
  Assign("GS-Version","%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','AFPL Ghostscript','   ');"); // Get the last Key!
  //? Enter the version explicitly if the above failed to detect the latest installed version
  // Assign("GS-Version","7.00");
  Assign("GS-Bin","%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','AFPL Ghostscript','%$(|GS-Version|)','GS_DLL');");
  Assign("GS-Lib","%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','AFPL Ghostscript','%$(|GS-Version|)','GS_LIB');");
  GetFilePath("%$('GS-Bin')", 0);
  Assign("GS-Bin","%!0");
  // Prompt("%$('GS-Bin')");  // Debugging

 - Page specification in the Print dialog now allows %p and %P
 variables to stand for the Current Page and Total Page numbers,
 respectively. Parameter %S truncates the string unless Print
 Selected Text Option is enabled. To enter % use %%...

   Default: Page %p of %P%S (selected)

 - OpenProject and CloseProject macros now have an optional
 parameter _level which allows you to Open only nodes on level
 less or equal than the specified limit and close only the nodes
 greater or equal to the specified limit. The Tree Form provides a
 drop down buttons OpenAll and CloseAll where the dropdown Menu
 provides and interface to the above macros with levels (0=all)
 2 and 3.

 - Open and Close Project event handlers now allow the
 specification of two macros: the first one is executed before the
 project is opened or closed and the other one is executed after.
 This should address the problem with the default folder after the
 documents have been restored...

 - Additional filter to prevent mistaking certain lines in TeX's
 Log file for c-style errors has been implemented...

 - A series of problems with using Large System Fonts have been
 addressed: the Dialogs and Forms (eg. Wizard) are now properly
 resized to accommodate all controls in different resolutions.
 Furthermore dropdown boxes and list controls now properly space
 lines when the font is larger: the items no longer overlap...

   The Spell Checking dialog now also displays a Cancel and OK
   button if you make it large enough for each button to fit in
   the panel on the right of the dialog.

 - Create User Profile macro has been modified to comply with the
 new distribution.

 - Some active strings were referring to %b instead of %B folder
 which disable their functionality after the User Profile is
 created.

 - The "Log File" menu item in the accessories has been renamed to
 "STD Log File" to make it clear that this document represents a
 STD Output+Error file captured by WinEdt while executing an
 application in a detached or background mode...

  - Enhanced and debugged version of Window switching macro:

    ActivateNextChild(Direction: -1..1, MDI Order: 0..2, Index: -1..99999);
      If the direction is 0 then you can specify the (zero-based)
      Index. Index=-1 is the last document... The direction can be
      based on the Tab Index or MDI Order (the same as as in the
      ListOpenedFiles function).

      Examples: ActivateNextChild(1,1); toggles between two documents
                ActivateNextChild(1); Next Tab
                ActivateNextChild(-1); Previous Tab
                ActivateNextChild(0,0,0); First Tab
                ActivateNextChild(0,0,-1); Last Tab
                ActivateNextChild(1,2); Next MDI Child (Ctrl+Tab)
                ActivateNextChild(-1,2); Previous MDI Child (Shift+Ctrl+Tab)

      The last two examples do not change the MDI Order. Others do:
      the newly activated child gets in front of the others...

      Note that this macro can be used to redefine the Next and
      Previous Child functionality. However, the MDI Shortcuts
      [Shift+]Ctrl+Tab cannot be suppressed and are always
      interpreted as the MDI Next and Previous commands.

    Windows Menu now contains the command to switch between
    documents (note the above restriction when it comes to
    assigning [Shift+]Ctrl+Tab shortcuts). You can place more such
    items based on the examples above and assign them shortcuts of
    your choice...

    In the new default settings the current document list is now
    packed in the Submenu at the bottom of the Windows Menu. If
    you don't like this Start the Menu Setup Dialog and delete the
    submenu at the end of the Windows Menu. Usually, the filenames
    are long and unless one uses the Windows Menu to switch
    between documents often it is best to keep the list in a
    submenu. The logic is the same as for the File and Project
    menus: if any of these menus end with an open and non-empty
    submenu then the list is maintained in this submenu rather
    than its parent (applies to File, Project and Windows menus,
    respectively).

  - A minor extension of the Prompt macro functionality (buttons 4
  mode was added):

   Prompt("Prompt",Type,Buttons: 0..4, "Macro 1","Macro 2","Macro Yes/No: Cancel");
     Displays the Dialog Box with the specified Prompt. Macro
     execution is resumed after the user closes the dialog box...
       Type:
        0: Information
        1: Confirmation
        2: Warning
        3: Error
       Buttons:
        0: OK Cancel (Cancel terminates macro execution)
        1: OK
        2: OK Cancel (Cancel sets OK flag to 0)
        3: Yes No
        4: Yes No Cancel (Cancel sets OK flag to 0 and executes the last macro)
     Depending on the clicked button the associated macro is
     executed...

  - A few extra bitmaps for toolbar and menu and an enhanced
  appearance of the TeX (lion) icon...

  - Slightly improved BibTeX templates...

  - Oddities with Regular Expressions in softly wrapped lines have
  been addressed...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20010613 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - WinEdt Macro Library is now on-line and alive:

    <http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~schlicht/winedt/index.html>

  - A problem with saving dictionaries (which could result in a
  crash during WinEdt's closing cycle) has been finally pinpointed
  and fixed.

  - The default settings now display the right margin as a
  highlighted column for ASCII mode. You can quickly enable such
  functionality for other modes (or disable it altogether) in the

    Options -> Highlighting| Columns Dialog

  Help in that dialog explains the details...

  - The WinExe macro has been slightly modified:

    The priority has been removed from the flags and it is now a
    parameter on its own with admissible values:

      -1=low 0=normal 1=high

  - The "Requires File" filter functionality has been extended to
  prevent accidental compilation of a log (instead of a tex source):

    If the file is preceded by <foo> then the file existence is
    only checked if the filename equals foo otherwise the result
    is false. Thus specifying:

      <%F>%P\%N.tex?<%F>%P\%N.ltx?<%F>%P\%N.dtx?<%F>%P\%N.ins?<%F>%P\%N.texi

    as a filter makes sure that the LaTeX button is enabled only if
    the Main File (or the current document) is one of the above.

  - WinEdt now allows backup and auto-save specifications such as:

    C:\your backup folder\%n%t.bak

  or even

    %p\Backup folder\%n%t

  if you want to create a backup folder within a project.

  The same goes for Auto Saving specification (previous
  specifications with wildcards remain the same but if there are no
  wildcards WinEdt now parses the file and creates the specified
  backup folder(s) if necessary).

  - The Insert Overwrite switch now affects how the Block Mode Cut
  and Paste operation act (as many users were expecting)...

  - New Macros (not extensively tested):

    SetTree("Data", Reset_MainFile: 0..1);

    Tested on the situations below:

        GetTree(0);InsText("%!0");

        *"C:\Alex\WinEdt\Samples\Thesis\Thesis.tex"
        * "C:\Alex\WinEdt\Samples\Thesis\ABS.tex"

                relative_path: 0..3);

WinEdt 5 [Build 20010402 (v. 5.3)]
==================================

  - A bug with lost Hard Returns when pasting text in Soft
  wrapping mode in the middle of the line is fixed.

  - "-D" Qualifier now produces an enhanced (%B\WinEdt.run) which
  can be used to track down any problems with event handlers (eg.
  access violation during the exit).

  - New macros:

      GetTag(Tag: 0..9, Register: 0..9);
      SetTag(Tag: 0..9, "Value");

  can be used for advanced Search/ Replace Macros.

  - New Macro:

      ListOpenedFiles(Register: 0..9, Order Flag: -2..2,
        "Mode Filter", "Filetype Filter",
        New: 0..1, Readonly: 0..1);

      Order Flag:

        -2 - decreasing MDI Order (Ctrl+Shift+Tab)
        -1 - decreasing Tab Order (Right to Left)
         0 - cyclic Tabs
         1 - Increasing Tab Order (Left to Right)
         2 - Increasing MDI Order (Ctrl+Tab)

    Filters can be used to select only certain documents. The
    result is a list of files starting in the first column and
    separated by CR+LF (EOLN). The list can be iterated with
    FindInString macro....

  - New Macros:

      ActivateNextChild(Direction: -1..1, MDI Order: 0..1, Index: -1..99999);

    If the direction is 0 then you can specify the (zero-based)
    Index. Index=-1 is the last document... The direction can be
    based on the Tab Index or MDI Order (the same as as in the
    ListOpenedFiles function).

    In this group there is also previously existing macro that can
    be used when iterating through opened documents:

      ActivateChild("Caption");


WinEdt 5 [Build 20010328 (v. 5.3)] (Spring alpha edition)
=========================================================

  - A few reported bugs and oddities pertaining to bookmarks have
  been addressed...

  - A bug with Popup Gather Window initialized through an external
  file interface (not WinEdt.gdi) has been fixed [not commonly
  encountered and not used in the default settings]

  - Book Marks are now better preserved when a large portion of
  a document if re-formatted (or a softly wrapped document is
  wrapped or un-wrapped).

  - The Appearance| Background Dialog now contains an interface
  that allows you to set the background color for alternative view
  (this way the "B" View can be displayed on a gray background
  alerting you that you are working at an alternative position).
  The background colors can be chosen from the Colors Common
  dialog and they do not depend on the 16 colors specified for
  highlighting in the Preferences| Colors dialog...

  - Bookmarks require an increased Left Margin specification (in
  the Preferences| Shell dialog). This may result in an unwanted
  illusion that your text is indented. To remedy this problem you
  can now specify the highlighting (background color) for the
  bookmarks portion of the left margin by introducing a column
  with the first column -1 and the last column specifying the
  margin between highlighted area and the text (values -2..-4 are
  recommended). This is done in the Highlighting| Columns dialog
  (the same background as Line Numbers is recommended to keep the
  screen moderately highlighted).

  - The Appearance| Advanced Dialog now provides an interface to
  choose up to 12 different sets of 14x14 bitmaps used for
  bookmarks. Currently only the default set is provided. However,
  users that prefer different bitmaps (lighter or darker) should
  send me a set of 10 14x14 alternative bitmaps of their choice
  and I'll include them in WinEdt's Default settings... The
  interface to use them is already there (hurry up with the
  alternatives!)...

  Custom bookmarks are loaded from %b or %B \Bitmaps\Bookmarks
  folder containing files A0.bmp..A9.bmp, ... ,K0.bmp..K9.bmp.

  - Context Popup Menu on the Left margin now contains Goto
  commands for all set Bookmarks.

  - The following macros have been introduced to provide better
  control of the Error Log file parsing and the execution flow
  control in compilation macros:

    ErrorLogUpdate(Force Update: 0..1);
      Updates the log file...

    IfLogErrors("Then","Else",noWarnings:0..1);

    CloseSTDHandle(#0..3);
      0 = STD Input
      1 = STD Output
      2 = STD Error
      3 = All (currently opened)

  - A fix with the ExportDoc macro should take care of nested
  attributes...

  - A new macro

      BookMarkLineNumber(Reg: 0..9, BookmarkIndex: 0..9);

    stores the line number assigned to the Bookmark Index
    (-1=not set) in the specified register %!0..%!9.

  - The meaning of the value -1 and 2 in some Bookmark macro
  functions has been reversed (from the first release) for the
  consistency sake (2 usually stands for toggle). The
  documentation below has been updated with the changes...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20010317 (v. 5.3)] (St. Patrick's alpha edition)
===============================================================

  - A few minor improvements in the default settings (including
    some minor fixes to the default macro scripts)

  - Get Mode Macro now parses the first two lines for the
    (optional) mode information...

  - The MDI Open Event handler is executed for New Templates

  - The "Quit Project" command removes the project from the list
  of recently opened projects

  - A new option "Track Files" in the Tree control (the selected
  node changes to the currently active document)...

  - A problem with a 512 character limit for environmental
  variables has been fixed...

  - GDI (Gather Interface) has an additional parameter for Pages
  in order to allow Pages always being sorted when displayed (see
  Doc\Gather.txt for details).

  - WinEdt now properly parses log files in UNIX format and
  recognizes extended C-style errors (including the FreePascal
  error log files).

  - The Tools Menu now has a new macro item Evaluate Integer
  Expression:

     LetRegNum(0,"%S");SetSel(0);Ins(" = %!0");

  It uses WinEdt to calculate a selected expression and inserts
  the result at the end of selected text. WinEdt supports nested
  expressions with +,-,*, and / operators and standard evaluation
  rules...

  - The Menu Setup| Advanced dialog now has an option

        "Custom Masked Image List Additions"

    When enabled, this option instructs WinEdt to add images using
    Windows API rather than Delphi's VCL interface. This fix
    should accelerate the startup and addresses some problems with
    extremely long delays and/ or poor quality images in the tool
    bar or menu. It remains to be seen what is the general result,
    but on my system loading of bitmaps is decreased from 1 sec.
    to approx. 0.55 second without any loss of quality...

  - A new (powerful) macro WinExe:

    WinExe("Executable","Command Line","Startup Folder","Caption",
           Flags:000000..111111, Priority: -1..1,
           "STD Input","STD Output","STD Error");

      0/1 Flags (form left to right):
        Maximize Application
        Run in the Background
        Detached Process
        Synchronize: wait for the termination before resuming
        Use STD I/O/Error Handles (if specified by filenames)
        Use the Startup Directory in the names of redirected STD I/O

  Note that this macro allows you to re-direct console
  application's IO and Error stream to files and thus run such
  process in a detached mode (often much faster). It can also be
  used to synchronize sequences of actions, etc...

    Example:
    ========

    WinExe('','C:\Alex\Delphi\Graphics\netpbm\bin\pngtopnm.exe',>
           'C:\Alex\Delphi\Graphics\Temp','NetPbm', >
    // isMax isBack isDetached doSync StdIO UseDir >
       011111,1,>
    // Input Output Error >
       'Image.png',>
       'Image.pnm',>
       '');
    End;

  - Autosaving now allows you to use the Alternation measure as a
  trigger for saving: the Alternation counter is increased when a
  line is modified and a new position is in some other line or
  when a group of actions is completed (pretty much based on the
  information in the Undo buffer). Some commands such as inserting
  or deleting a string in a paragraph with auto wrapping on can
  trigger two alternations. When the Alternation count exceeds a
  threshold specified in the Preferences| Backup Dialog the
  Autosaving takes place (and the Alternation counter is reset
  back to 0). Furthermore, if you choose to redirect auto-save to
  files with a different extension (eg. *.*.sav or *.aus) you can
  instruct WinEdt to delete such files when the real file is saved
  or when WinEdt is closed. Such Autosaving can be combined with
  the existing one triggered by a timer (if you really want to be
  on a safe side)...

  - Support for 10 bookmarks per document with visual feedback:

    Before taking advantage of this feature you should increase
    the left margin in Options->Preferences| Shell Dialog to at
    least 14 (required for visual feedback)

    WinEdt implements the following macros that can be used to
    implement a custom Bookmark Keyboard interface of your choice:

      SetBookMark(Index: -1..9);
      GOTOBookMark(Index: -1..10, Center Line: 0..2,
                   Extend Selection [if not greater than]: 0..15);
      ClearBookMarks(All Documents: 0..1);
      BookMarkLineNumber(Reg: 0..9, BookmarkIndex: 0..9);

    If the Center Line Parameter is set to 2 then the line is
    centered only if it is not visible while 0 completely
    suppresses line centering...

    Once you set the bookmark, the corresponding line is marked by
    an icon displaying the index of the bookmark. Bookmarks are
    floating (ie. they move if the text is inserted or deleted
    anywhere previous to the marked position).

    By default the following Keyboard interface has been
    implemented:

      Ctrl+Alt+0..9:    SetBookMark(0..9);
      Ctrl+0..9:        GOTOBookMark(0..9,1,0);

    Currently no Shortcut assigned:

      SetBookMark(-1); - Use the first available Book Mark
                         (or 9 if all bookmarks are assigned)
      GOTOBookMark(-1,1,0) - Go to The Previous Bookmark (Backward)
      GOTOBookMark(10,1,0) - Go to The Next Bookmark (Forward)

    Note, however, that you can place these commands in an
    invisible Popup Menu and provide a double-shortcut scheme that
    you may be accustomed to from some other environment. To
    remove a bookmark you have to assign the same bookmark while
    you are in the marked line. In particular, marking the place
    twice adds and removes the bookmark...

    Alternatively you can assign the Macro ClearBookMarks to the
    shortcut of your choice.

    Bookmarks are preserved in WinEdt's Project file(s) if the
    corresponding option in the Preferences| Project dialog is
    enabled...

        Known Issue: Heavy Undoing and Redoing can result in
        misplaced bookmarks inside a paragraph (especially when
        auto wrapping is turned on). Solution: manually correct
        the bookmark after such undoing (if necessary).

  - In addition to Bookmarks, WinEdt maintains two different views
  of the same document. Although this functionality currently
  falls short of displaying split Windows with two different text
  segments it comes with a handy interface:

  The first panel in the status line displays the letter "A" or
  "B" for the primary and secondary view of the file. Clicking on
  this panel allows you to jump from one to another view with a
  single click. This can come in handy if you want to copy and
  paste some text segment into another position or if you are
  working on two places simultaneously. The view contains
  information about the selected text as well, and it is preserved
  in WinEdt's Project file (similarly to bookmarks).

    ChangeView(Flag: -1..2, Set View: 0..1, Center: 0..1);
      Flag:    -1 - don't change the current view
                0 - primary view (A)
                1 - secondary view (B)
                2 - toggle view

      Set View: 1 -  (set the alternative view to the current view:
                      makes sense with the flag -1)

      Center:   0 = never
                1 = only if not visible on the screen
                2 = always (if the line changes)

  If clicking on the Status Line Panel is not your preferred
  interface, you can assign a shortcut of your choice to the Macro
  Menu Item ChangeView(2);

  To make the first status line panel in an upgraded version of
  WinEdt visible, specify a non-empty string (eg. A) in the
  Appearance| Status Line Dialog.

    Remark: there is a good reason for WinEdt not yet
    simultaneously maintaining two different views on the screen.
    Such functionality will require an extra layer in WinEdt's
    screen management routines, and its implementation is not
    straightforward. A large chunk of complicated code will have
    to be rewritten, with lots of testing to be done before
    the result performs reasonably well on different platforms.
    For now I've decided against it but it remains on my to-do
    list...

  - The following macro has been introduced to add Line Numbers
  on the left of the text:

    ShowLineNumbers(Visible: 0..2);
    // Invisible=0 Visible=1 Toggle=2

  Line numbers are displayed on the screen for reference, but they
  are not inserted in the text.

   NB: WinEdt also has a very different command "Enumerate Lines..."
    which inserts line numbers in the text (or selected block).
    This command modifies the text and has to be used with care
    (only if you really want the numbers to be inserted in your
    document)... By default the command is in the Tools Menu.

  The displayed line numbers are highlighted as specified in the
  Highlighting| Columns dialog: the first enabled column scheme
  with the first and the last column specified as 0 is applied.
  Note that selecting a dark background can result in flickering
  when the page is scrolled (choose a light background color).

  Right-clicking on the left margin (in the child window) brings up
  a popup menu that can be used to Erase the bookmarks and Toggle
  the presence of the Line Numbers.

  - A new macro interface for Save All functionality allows more
  demanding users to customize this action:

    SaveAll(Confirm: 0..1, Focus: 0..1,
       Project Files Only: 0..1,
       New Documents: 0..1,
       Readonly Documents: 0..1);

  With Confirm Option the macro prompts with a All/Yes/No/Cancel
  confirmation dialog. The document to which the confirmation
  applies is (optionally) brought in the foreground. The Project
  Files Only options determine if the Save All applies only to the
  files that are currently in the Project Tree... The remaining
  two (optional) parameters enable the action for new and readonly
  documents (respectively).

  - Occasionally you may want to export a document in some other
  format while preserving the highlighting scheme as used by
  WinEdt. This can be done through a macro ExportDoc. Below is an
  example of usage of this macro that exports a document in HTML
  format. Note that this macro does not perform any conversion on
  the TeX<->HTML level (or anything of this kind); it simply
  exports ASCII text with highlighting attributes as used by
  WinEdt. The example below is best viewed in <pre>...</pre> or
  <tt>...</tt> HTML environment. The macro does not provide any
  header or trailer and the resulting file has to be embedded in
  an HTML document:

    // Export Highlighted Document in HTML Format
    //
    // If the filename is missing then Output File is considered:
    //   if previously opened with OpenOutput Macro
    //   in this case the file has to be closed with CloseOutput...
    //
    // RGB: 0 = HEX FF0000 (Red)
    //      1 = DEC 255 0 0 (Red)
    //      3 = PERCENT 100 0 0 (Red)
    //      4 = Fraction 1.00 0.00 0.00 (Red)
    //
    //        Color Delimiter has to be entered for 1..3:
    //        in out example ' ' is specified as RGB delimiter
    //
    // HTML_Export Translation Table should be defined to take care of:
    //
    //   """" -> "&quot;"
    //   " " -> "&nbsp;"
    //   "&" -> "&amp;"
    //   "<" -> "&lt;"
    //   ">" -> "&gt;"

    ExportDoc('%f.html', // Output File<>
      0,                 // HEX RGB Format<>
      '',                // RGB Color: Delimiter<>
      '">',              // RGB Color: Trailing String<>
      '<font color="#',  // RGB Color: Start + RGB<>
      '</font>',         // RGB Color: End<>
      '<i>',             // Font: Start Italic<>
      '</i>',            // Font: End Italic<>
      '<b>',             // Font: Start Bold<>
      '</b>',            // Font: End Bold<>
      '<u>',             // Font: Start Underline<>
      '</u>',            // Font: End Underline<>
      '<s>',             // Font: Start Strikeout<>
      '</s>',            // Font: End Strikeout<>
      '<br>',            // Line Break (or '' if inside <pre> ... </pre>)<>
      'HTML_Export');    // Translation Table: Char -> String!!!

    End;

  - Note that comments at the end of concatenated lines are now
  admissible if the line ends with <> (as in the example above).
  The line end >> strips the comment (if any) starting from the
  left margin while <> searches for the comment backward...

  - The Macros ExtractSettings and LoadSettings now have optional
  parameters that can be used to export and import only selected
  components.

    Parameters:

      Filename,
      Selected Items Flag: 0..1 // 1 = use the rest of parameters
        Errors: 0..1
        Wrapping: 0..1
        Comments: 0..1
        Word Count: 0..1
        Sounds: 0..1
        Static Data: 0..1

  The data has to be exported with the same parameters as used in
  the import function. Note that this allows (advanced users) to
  quickly change the Error Processing data (once they prepare and
  export alternative settings)...

WinEdt 5 [Build 20001220 (v. 5.2)]
==================================

  - A bug in the "Create Personal Profile.edt" macro has been
  fixed:

      LetReg(2,"%@('HKEY_CURRENT_USER','Software', 'WinEdt', 'INIT');");

    should be

      LetReg(2,"%@('HKEY_CURRENT_USER','Software', 'WinEdt', 'INIT', ' ');");

  - A bug with non-existent (subsequently deleted or moved) files
  persisting in the file list is fixed...

  - A new macro:

   ChangeKeyboard(Iterate: -99..99; Flag: -1..1);
     Interface to Windows ActivateKeyboardLayout API function.

     See: ...Doc\Macros.txt for the full description.

  - Some changes to prevent problems during the first activation
  have been made to the "...Config\WinEdt-Env.edt" macro and the
  Configuration Wizard initialization code...


WinEdt 5 [Build 20001215 (v. 5.2)]
==================================

 - The problem with non-default Code Pages in the Spelling dialog
 has been fixed. Dialogs that use the "Custom Font" now use proper
 Script in the Combo and List Boxes. This problem was particularly
 obvious with the Spell Checking Suggestions which may not be
 displayed properly when the dictionary did not use the default
 ANSI encoding.

 To further address this problem the Spell Checking Dialog now has
 an option which determines if the Caption of the Suggestions
 dialog reflects the current selection. The font in the Caption
 cannot be customized and words encoded in non-standard scripts
 are not properly displayed in the Caption. In this case simply
 disable the Option "Use Caption"...

 The above changes only affect some users with non-Western version
 of Windows (eg. cp1250).

____________________________________________________________________

WinEdt 5 [Build 20001213 (v. 5.2)]
==================================

This is the official release of WinEdt 5 with enhanced settings
and additional configurations. The code for this release has been
patched with fixes for all reported problems encountered in WinEdt
5.1 on different platforms.

Here is the summary of (major) new features and recent additions:

    - New Macros:

        CreateFolders("Folder", CreatePath: 0..1);
        CopyFile("Source", "Destination", Overwrite: 0..1, CreatePath: 0..1);
        MoveFile("Source", "Destination");
        DeleteFile("Filename");
        RemoveDirectory("Directory Name");

        SetEnvVar("Name","String Value");
        SetWinEdtRegStr("String Name","String Value");

        SetRegKey("HKEY_...","Key1\Key2...","String Value");
        SetRegStr("HKEY_...","Key1\Key2...","String Name","String Value");
        RegDeleteKey("HKEY_...","Key1\Key2...","Delete Key Name");
        RegDeleteValue("HKEY_...","Key1\Key2...","Delete Value Name");

            Registry Handle must specify one of the following reserved
            handles (case sensitive):
                HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
                HKEY_CURRENT_USER
                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
                HKEY_USERS

    Some of these macros are used in the new Network installation
    macro to create local WinEdt folder(s) and copy the User
    Application Data.

      WARNING: Use with care (or if you are not experience don't
      use them at all in your custom macro scripts...)!

    - "Direct" configurations for MiKTeX and fpTeX have been
    reinstated in the Options| Configurations Dialog. These
    configurations are "safe" because they do not rely on BATCH
    files that may be problematic on certain platforms. If you are
    experiencing problems with the default configuration execute
    the "MiKTeX Direct!" command in order to update the accessories
    menu (the same goes for fpTeX users).

    - The Restore macros in WinEdt's Options| Configurations Menu
    now allow users to select the components that are to be
    Restored. This can come handy when you upgrade and want to
    keep your custom settings but may still want to upgrade
    certain individual menus to their new default contents and
    appearance... For more information consult the ".txt" files in
    WinEdt's Config folders...

    - A column of buttons with frequent actions (Replace, Global
    Replace, Add) has been reinstated in the Spell Checking Dialog
    (popular demand)

    - FindInString Macro is now much faster (especially for large
    strings).

    - A bug with the "Erase Working Files" Mode Filter is fixed
    (submodes were not handled properly!)

    - A bug with numeric expressions (parameters for macros) containing
    brackets is fixed.

    - The LetRegNum macro has been enhanced to allow basic
    formatting of the string:

      LetRegNum(StrRegister: 0..9, Num_Expression;
             Length: 0..99; Leading Zeros: 0..99);

    - The macro Mark(Scope) now traces the Bookmark after the
    paragraph is formatted (previous behavior resulted in
    oddities with some Macros in the Default Insert Menu).

    - The Macro IfFileExists("\"); returned true which prevented
    the Startup macro from detecting certain TeX installations
    (MiKTeX users should not be affected).

    - A Context Popup Menu in the Search/ Replace Dialogs now has
    an option for "Auto Scope" selection...

    - A bug (refresh oddity) with Showing Hard returns has been
    fixed.

    - A bug with missing %%PATH%% in Config\WinEdt-Env.edt has
    been fixed...

    - Help and the Doc folder have been seriously updated!

____________________________________________________________________

The following new macros have been implemented and are used in
the default setup:


 EraseWorkingFiles("Interface.edt","Startup Folder","Caption",Subfolders: -1..1);
   This macro displays a dialog box with a checkbox list of files
   to be deleted. The list is based on the macro script specified
   as the first parameter. The default "Erase Output Files" item
   in the Accessories Menu is defined as:

      EraseWorkingFiles("%B\Bin\Erase Working Files.edt",
        "%P","Erase Output Files",0);

   The default ("%B\Bin\Erase Working Files.edt") Interface looks like:

        // Erase Working Files Interface
        // =============================
        //
        // Modify the default in this value (if needed):
        //
        //      AddFileItem(Enabled: 0..1, "Description","Filename","Mode Filter");
        //
        // Use the macro EraseWorkingFiles to invoke a GUI for this interface:
        //
        //      EraseWorkingFiles("Interace.edt","Mode Filter","Caption", Subfolders: -1..1);

            AddFileItem(1,"DVI File","%N.dvi","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"PDF File","%N.pdf","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"PS  File","%N.ps","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"TOC Files","%N.toc","TeX");

            AddFileItem(1,"LOG File","%N.log","");
            AddFileItem(1,"TMP Files","*.tmp","");

            AddFileItem(0,"BAK Files","*.bak","");

            AddFileItem(1,"AUX Files","*.aux","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"BBL Files","*.bbl","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"BLG Files","*.blg","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"IDX Files","*.idx","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"IND Files","*.ind","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"ILG Files","*.ilg","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"GLS Files","*.gls","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"GLO Files","*.glo","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"LOF Files","*.lof","TeX");
            AddFileItem(1,"LOT Files","*.lot","TeX");

        End;

 AddFileItem(Enabled: 0..1, "Description","Filename","Mode Filter");
   Used in the Interface for EraseWorkingFiles...

   For more information Consult the Help in the Dialog.

____________________________________________________________________


 ShowCheckList("Caption", Width: 300..1000, Height: 250..1000);
   This macro displays a dialog containing a check-box list. The
   contents of the list and the actions taken depending  on which
   box is checked are user-definable with the macros that follow:

 ClearCheckList;
   Erase the checkbox list.

 AddCheckList("Check Box Caption", Checked: 0..1);
   Add a new item to the list. Up to 999 items are admissible.

 IfChecked(Index: 0..999, "Then Macro", "Else Macro");
   After the dialog has been executed an action depending on which
   box is checked can be specified.

   Example:
   ========

   For real examples check the macros _Backup.edt and _Restore.edt
   in WinEdt's ...Config\Default folder.

        // Update selected Main Menu Components

            Requires(20001122);

WinEdt 5 [Build 20001115 (v. 5.2)]
==================================

    - The documentation and Help have been updated with the
    information relevant for this version of the program...
    The Help file now displays important information and examples in
    Courier New font which (hopefully) makes it much easier to read.

    - A default response for active strings \cite{} and \ref{}
    (used for cross referencing) has been modified to bring up a
    popup (resizable) form that allows keyboard interface to locate
    the label or tag in the list of collected items. The file(s):

       %B\Macros\Active Strings\Cite.edt
       %B\Macros\Active Strings\Ref.edt

     define the detailed behavior of the interface. The following
     macro function has been implemented (and is called in the above
     macro scripts) to allow this new functionality:

       GDIPopup("Page","Caption",
         Refresh,Sort,Track_onClick,Track_onDblClick,OK_onDblClick:0..1);

    Depending on the size of your project and the speed of your
    computer you may have to turn the Refresh in the default
    settings off if you find the response too slow...

    - A nice (mode-sensitive) GUI for "Erase Working Files"
    command has been implemented. The default Erase Working Files
    item in WinEdt's Accessories Menu is no longer defined as a
    call to the Batch file but calls the macro:

      EraseWorkingFiles("%B\Bin\Erase Working Files.edt",
        "%P","Erase Output Files",0);

    For more details consult the macro interface

      "%B\Bin\Erase Working Files.edt"

    which can be modified for your particular needs...

    - The spell checking dialog has been redesigned: It no longer
    has two rows of buttons (which are not a suitable interface
    for too many actions). Instead it provides a menu with
    pre-defined shortcuts for (grouped) actions. The dialog is now
    user-resizable.

        I know that some users might prefer buttons but having 10
        buttons stacked at the side of a dialog (plus a mysterious
        popup context menu with [hard-to-find] options) is a poor
        GUI design and the change is final. After a while you'll
        see that most common responses are Enter (Replace) or ESC
        (Cancel) and/ or Alt+R,G,I,A (for Replace, Global Replace,
        Ignore, and Add actions) and until you get used to them
        you can always choose the required action from the Actions
        Menu in the Dialog (using either a mouse or a keyboard
        interface).

    For consistency's sake the Complete Word dialog is now also
    user-resizable...

    - A major new feature (lacking in the official release of WinEdt
    5.1) is the ability of tracking the input files from [La]TeX's
    log file. This is now implemented. Thus MiKTeX users no longer
    have to use any "src*.sty" packages or non-standard input
    directives (such as \Input) in order to make WinEdt properly
    locate a sub-document containing an error...

    - The default shortcut for the Cancel command has been changed
    from ESC to Shift+ESC in order prevent unwanted cancellation
    of message boxes or modal dialogs that might have been
    displayed during the cancelled operation. Note that the
    execution of out-of-control macros and lengthy  operations
    that might have gone out of control can be Cancelled by
    pressing and holding the Shift+ESC key (rather than killing
    WinEdt)...

    - The Preferences| Editor Dialog has an option "Smart Line
    Centering". When enabled it prevents the Find, Replace, Spell
    Word, Complete Word and Paragraph/Up/Down commands to center
    the line if the line is already visible on the screen thus
    reducing the unwanted (and sometimes distracting) jumps...

    - The Preferences| Backup Dialog has two new Options pertaining
    to file sharing.

    - The "Save" command is now enabled for New documents (even if
    they are not modified). The "Save All" command gets disabled
    when no document needs saving. Note that the Option "Save All
    Applies to New documents" in the Preferences| Saving Dialog
    affects the saving of new documents with the Save All command.
    By default it is disabled (in 5.1 it does not work properly
    when enabled and the new documents are usually exempt from
    saving regardless of the above preference- this has now been
    fixed)...

    - A (tricky) bug with files being removed from the File List
    when the Gather interface was collecting items in non-opened
    files is fixed.

    - The "EDT" mode for writing WinEdt macros (highlighting,
    spelling, and code-completion) is now included with the
    default settings together with an enhanced and updated HTML
    mode.

    - WinEdt 5.2 is MiKTeX 2.x aware. It also provides basic
    configurations for fpTeX (web2c) and YandY TeX (see the
    Options| Configurations Menu)...

    - The default settings provide an interface to many PDF
    conversion utilities (as well as MiKTeX's TeXify utility that
    can compile and process documents as required)... An interface
    to AMS TeX is also provided (amstex is included in MiKTeX 2.0).

    - The Options Menu provides (macro) items that allow you to
    associate WinEdt with certain file types. There is also a set
    of commands (macros) that install TeX Icons (making TeX feel
    more at home on Windows platform). Read the associated ".txt"
    files in the Options Menu for more details...

    - Changes to the Startup macro make it easier to fix and
    diagnose problems related to the location of TeX accessories
    and the value of the PATH environmental variable.

    - Network and Multi-user configurations have been automated and
    WinEdt can create personal profiles for users transparently.
    Read the file 0Readme.txt in WinEdt's Network folder for more
    information on such installations.

    - Numerous enhancements to the default settings and WinEdt's
    Menu and GUI have been implemented for this release (eg. a more
    consistent use of menu icons and slightly redesigned tool bar).

    - The Configuration Wizard (see WinEdt's Help Menu) now
    provides more detailed diagnosis and instructions when certain
    TeX components cannot be detected...

    - The default settings define

      [Exe("%B\Macros\GetMode.edt")]

    as the MDI Open Macro event handler in the Preferences| Events
    dialog. This macro determines the mode of the document from
    the comment in the first line (if present)- emacs convention.
    For more details and examples check out the

      "...Macros\GetMode.txt"

    document.

    - Samples in the Macros folder have been extended and
    updated...

    - The Menu Setup dialog now allows an option "Invisible Item"
    that can be used to make any item invisible (hardly ever
    needed but it's there just in case).

    - WinEdt now comes with a larger English dictionary containing
    US and UK spelling conventions (before it was only available
    as a separate download). Check the file English.txt in WinEdt's
    Dict\English folder...

    - The filters for enabling accessories have been changed
    (hopefully for the better but let me know if you experience
    problems): still better make changes to the "Requires File"
    filter in the Menu Setup and let me know why the default
    settings were not acceptable for you...

---------------------------------------

The following new macro functions have been implemented since the
release of WinEdt 5.1:

    SetErrorFlag(isError: 0..2);
    GDIReset;
    GDISort;
    GDICopy;
    LoadPrint("Filename");
    ExtractPrint("Filename");
    QuitWinEdt;
    SetSaveWinEdtConfig(AutoSave_onExit: 0..1);
    ShowHardReturns(Visible: 0..2);
    GDIPopup("Page","Caption",Refresh,Sort,Track_onClick,Track_onDblClick,OK_onDblClick:0..1);
    SetSort(Ascending,Case_Sensitive,Ignore_Length,Remove_Duplicates: #-1..1);
    SaveSort;
    RestoreSort;
    EraseWorkingFiles("Interace.edt","Mode Filter","Caption",Subfolders: -1..1);
    AddFileItem(Enabled: 0..1, "Description","Filename","Mode Filter");

Additional parameters for the Run macro:

    Run("Command Line","Startup Directory",
      Maximized,Background: 0..1,"Caption",Focus,Append: 0..1);

Additional parameters for the Open macro:

    Open("Document Name", Readonly:-1..1, Update: -1..1, "Document Mode");

WinEdt 5 [Build 20000415 (v. 5.1)]
==================================

April 2000:
===========

The alpha and beta versions of the next major release of WinEdt
have been around for over a year under the name WinEdt 2000 or
WinEdt2K. Unfortunately, this name caused WinEdt to be frequently
mistaken for another program: programmers code editor WinEdit
2000. The misunderstandings were made even more frequent because
of the similarity of the www address:

    WinEdt <> WinEdit    and    winedt.com <> winedit.com !!!


After quite some feedback from WinEdt's Mailing List the decision
was made to simply call the next release with its version number
(rather than any suffix such as 2000, 2K, or +). The old version
enumeration method (inspired by Knuth's method of labeling
versions of TeX with digits of pi) was to add the next digit of
sqrt(2) and use the approximation as WinEdt's version identifier.
The current release would be 1.4142. However, this method is
getting a bit confusing since many users fail to recognize the
significance of the last digit(s). That's why a "standard"
version enumeration is being adopted from here on. This being the
fifth major release of WinEdt, the program is now officially
called "WinEdt 5". The Build and Version number (v. 5.1) as
displayed in the About Dialog identifies the date when the
program was compiled and it could be used to unambiguously
identify your instance of the program. This information can now
be copied from WinEdt's About Dialog into the clipboard (use the
popup context menu responding to the right-mouse clicks on the
Build Edit control in the About Dialog!).

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000415:
===============

Minor default setup problem with the Exit procedure has been fixed.

IfOK macro now detects the status of execution for Delimiter
Match and most other editor commands (I did not extensively test
it-- hopefully it works)...

A (rare) problem with Focusing WinEdt when Windows Open Dialog
was visible and a document was opened through the explorer
interface (right-click+popup context menu) is fixed. The problem
was not commonly observed because most users double-click on the
selected files in the Open Dialog and only occasionally would one
use the explorer functionality in the Open Common Dialog...

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000413:
===============

Minor improvements to the default settings and documentation...

The Help File has been updated and re-compiled...

The file Macros.txt has been updated with accurate information
pertaining to the current state of WinEdt's Macro Language...

A bug with the automatic update of externally modified files has
been fixed.

New Macros:

  SaveFind;
  RestoreFind;

can be used to save and restore the Search attributes. The active
strings in HTML Mode have been modified to restore previous
Search attributes after performing a backward RegEx search...

If the folder is specified in

  Exe("Macro File Name", "Default Directory");

the default folder previous to the execution of the macro is
restored before the macro returns. Thus the configuration macros
in WinEdt's Options Menu no longer change your working directory.

The default settings now have the Option "Ignore Metrics" in the
context popup menu corresponding to the Preferences| Font Dialog
enabled. This in some cases speeds up the screen refreshing and
should not cause any problems if you are using truly monospaced
font. If you observe any screen refresh oddities disable this
option and let me know what font you are using in WinEdt.

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000405:
===============

Some (minor) fixes recently discussed on the mailing list...

A few enhancements to the default settings (new menu images)...

WinEdt's Gather Interface can now collect items in the files
belonging to the project tree without opening all the documents.
See "...Doc\Gahter.txt" for more details on the new
functionality, the purpose of bullets in front of the collected
items and a few examples...

The default settings in this version illustrate how one can
quickly change the font through a pre-defined menu commands.
There is a sample Options| Font Menu  with a few predefined fonts
and the instructions ("...Config\Fonts\0Readme.txt") on how to
prepare more...

The pdf macros now use DDE to close all the documents in the
Acrobat Reader to prevent the file access conflict between
pdflatex or dvipdfm and the AcroRd32.

The following new Macros have been implemented:

  GetLine(Reg: 0..9, Line: 1..16000000);
    Store the line in the current document into the specified
    register.

  GetTree(Reg: 0..9);
    Stores the current Tree into the String. Can be used to iterate
    through the project files and perform tasks on them... Example:
       *"C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Samples\Thesis\Thesis.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\ABS.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\ACK.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\T0.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\T1.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\T2.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\T3.tex"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\xBib.bib"
       * "C:\Program Files\WinEdt\Config\Thesis.bbl"

In the Project| Events Dialog there is now a new event handler:

  MDI Open Document

New macros to set the event handlers have been implemented:

  SetOnMDIOpen(");
  SetOnMDIActivate(");
  SetOnStartup(");
  SetOnExit(");
  SetOnPrjOpen(");
  SetOnPrjClose(");

For example, by default the Startup Macro is set to

  [Exe('%B\Config\Startup.edt')]

which in turn defines

  SetOnExit("[Exe('%B\Config\Exit.edt')]"); // Cleanup on Exit...

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000329 contains a few fixes:
====================================

Some (minor) fixes recently discussed on the mailing list...

There are now 250 (rather than 100) available buttons for the
ToolBar and Menu Images. By default only the first 100 are used.

Better delimiter matching for toggled delimiters such as $...$ in
TeX documents.

Custom Translation Tables for Sorting...

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000319 contains a few fixes:
====================================

An attempt to fix recent problems with the Scroll Wheel has been
made (it appears that an old bug in Delphi's VCL has returned to
haunt me). The Option for "Custom Wheel Response" has been moved
to the Appearance| Advanced Dialog and the Wheel should now work
regardless of this option if you have a recent enough mouse driver
or else the Custom Response should make the Wheel Work with older
drivers. Those that reported problems please let me know...

Also the Refresh oddity when switching between maximized MDI
windows by pressing Tabs should now be fixed.

The Preferences| Save Dialog now hosts most of the options
pertaining to Saving (which were before scattered around for
historic reasons and many users were not able to find them). Help
update pending...

The Panels that host docked controls have now been modified so as
to prevent users from shrinking them to the size 0 (which was
causing problems and was puzzling a few users).

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000316 contains a few enhancements and fixes:
=====================================================

WinEdt now provides a custom response to the mouse Scroll Wheel
(if required due to an obsolete device driver).

WinEdt now allows language sensitive sorting (including custom
compare tables).

A bug with the SendMessage macro (it used to call the PostMessage
function) is now fixed and the new PDFLaTeX.edt macro should now
work on all versions of Acrobat Reader...

A bug with the (NOT) Required File field has been fixed: useful
for the CS-RCS setup...

The contents of the Preferences Dialog has been slightly
re-arranged (hopefully for the better) based on the responses from
a few users that could not find certain options. The appearance
of (custom) buttons and bitmaps in dialogs has been improved...

The Context Menu corresponding to the tabs now contains a "Close
File" command that can be used to close any document by
right-clicking on its Tab and choosing this menu command...

The Select Paragraph Command has been modified to select indented
paragraphs (even when the option "Format Indented Lines" is
disabled). This change also affects the command "Format
Paragraph": after thinking about it for a while I realized that
this change makes sense...

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000309 contains two major bug fixes:
============================================

- Changing the "Hot Track" or the "Custom Colors" property of the
Document Tabs from the Context Popup Menu resulted in disabled
and invisible Tabs (and a consequent crash when exiting WinEdt):
fixed!

- Horizontal Scroll Bar in documents was not working at all:
fixed!


Both Bugs were introduced in the Build: 20000308...

____________________________________________________________________


Build 20000308:
===============

The following problems have been addressed for for this Build:

- A (critical!) bug with scrolling in docked Gather form is fixed

- An error in macros for insertion of matrices and arrays have
been fixed (a missing ")"),

- WinEdt now allows more than one row of document tabs. There is
a new option in the Appearance| Tabs Dialog that controls this
behavior. The Tab control gets automatically re-sized. Although
with 50+ document tabs the control produces some visual
flickering when adding or removing new document tabs (depends on
your hardware) it can still come handy for users that want direct
access to a few dozen opened files (assuming they have a large
enough screen to use the upper space for 3 or 4 rows of document
tabs).

- Most WinEdt's Modal dialogs now center with respect to the Main
Form rather than the screen. Also the "Parent Font" inheritance
have been disabled in some dialogs to prevent odd alignment of
buttons in dialogs as experienced by users that use larger
default fonts...

- A minor problem with rearranging the tool bar and dropping the
buttons on the left edge has been fixed. This might have to do
with the two reported spaces on the left of the first button...

- In the Syntax Highlighting Dialog -> Columns, the heading says
Highligted columns (missing h): fixed...

- A bug with the ghost caret after scrolling by clicking on the
scroll bars is fixed.

- The email and www field in WinEdt's About box now respond to
clicks (made possible by the macros below and the ShellExecute
macro function)...

- The following new macro functions have been implemented:

  SetFolder("Path");
  SetEnvVar("Name","String Value");
  SetRegKey("KEY_...","Key1\Key2...","String Value");
  SetRegStr("KEY_...","Key1\Key2...","Strung Name","String Value");
  SetWinEdtRegStr("String Name","String Value");

  SendMail("Subject","Text","Recipients","Attachments");

  For example:
  ============

    SendMail('Test Message',"Attached is WinEdt.txt",>
      "WinEdt Team|support@winedt.com","%F|WinEdt.txt");

    You can specify more than one recipient or attachment
    (separate up to 1024 items by semi-columns ;)

    The second optional filename, following the bar |, is the one
    that the recipient sees...

    All parameters are optional and can be entered or modified
    once the e-mail client is started.

    If a recipient is preceded by "*" or "?" the massage is CC'd
    or BCC'd (respectively) to that address:

      "WinEdt Team|support@winedt.com;*Alex|alex@winedt.net"


IMPORTANT: The MAPISendFunction (and the rest of the MAPI
interface on which the default WinEdt's Send Mail command and
macro rely) does not work unless the Windows Registry contains
the string MAPI with value "1". This can be checked and set from
within WinEdt with:

  // Returns the value 1?
  %@("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE","SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem","MAPI");

  // Sets the value to 1
  SetRegStr("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE",>
    "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem", "MAPI", "1");

If WinEdt's Send Mail Command fails and WinEdt detects the
absence of the above Registry Entry the user is prompted to allow
WinEdt to add the value and restart the program. The lack of this
registry key indicates that your email client may not support
MAPI in which case the above fix won't make any difference.
However, in some cases it is possible that although your email
client has a sufficient MAPI functionality to allow WinEdt to
send email messages the registry was not appropriately modified
during its installation. The above fix will enable the MAPI
functionality (assuming that it is supported by your email
program). For example, the registry entry may have been deleted
when you uninstall some other email client that you are not using
(eg. Outlook Express)...

WinEdt 5 [pre-release, beta and alpha history (v. 5.0)]
=======================================================

The alpha and beta versions of the next major release of WinEdt
have been around for over eight months under the name WinEdt 2000
or WinEdt2K. Unfortunately, this name caused WinEdt to be
frequently mistaken for another program: programmers code editor
WinEdit 2000. The misunderstandings were made even more frequent
because of the similarity of the www address:

- Changing the "Hot Track" or the "Custom Colors" property of the
Document Tabs from the Context Popup Menu resulted in disabled

If you've installed WinEdt 5 [Build: 20000308] you can only
download the basic Patch and Upgrade to WinEdt 5 and unzip the
archive over your existing WinEdt 5 installation!

____________________________________________________________________


Below is a complete history of additions and fixes since the
release of WinEdt32:

What's new since release 1.414 19-8 (October 1998)?
===================================================

May 1999:
---------

Bug Fixes:

  - access violation with entering the Main Document directly in
  the project setup dialog...
  - infinite loop with certain "Replace All" regular expressions
  has been fixed
  - a bug with saving documents even when they are not modified
  when launching a utility (such as LaTeX) is fixed...
  - a rare problem with scroll bars on Win95 has been reported to
  be fixed (scroll bars were not visible in child windows and the
  page down command caused an access violation)
  - over 20 reported (minor) oddities and bugs has been fixed
  (hopefully without introducing any new problems)

New features:

  - Most dialogs are now equipped with Buttons and Tool Bars that
  provide alternative access to the commands available in Context
  Popup Menus. Many users were not comfortable with the Context
  Menus (right mouse clicks) and additional interface hopefully
  makes the program more intuitive....

  - Project Management: WinEdt now allows you to to save currently
  opened files and desktop to "*.prj" files. The file-list is no
  longer stored in WinEdt.ini but in the project files that can be
  opened, created and restored through the newly introduced
  Project Management Commands. By default these commands are
  placed at the bottom of the project menu. Furthermore, WinEdt
  stores up to 10 recently opened projects in Windows registry and
  optionally appends them to the project menu... Those users that do
  not care for multi-project functionality can continue to work as
  before. Their "Default" project file-list is stored in
  WinEdt.prj (making future upgrading procedure easier if you
  decide to inherit the new default settings while preserving your
  file-list)...

    As a consequence of the new functionality a Project Setup
    Dialog has been redesigned to include only information
    pertaining to the current project. To accommodate the rest of
    its ex-contents (Templates, etc...) the Preferences Dialog
    has been expanded.

  - Project File can be accessed through the following parameters:
      %!f - Project File
      %!p -  ... path
      %!n -  ... name
      %!t -  ... type (usually .prj)

  - New variable:
  %!l    Paragraph Number
         In Soft Wrapping Mode this parameter should be used for Search
         because that's how TeX sees your wrapped paragraphs/ lines!
         Otherwise this value coincides with the Line Number.
         Similarly SelPar should be used for SoftMode Inverse
         Search (again it acts as SelLine otherwise).

  - Status Line contains two optional custom panels that can
    display any combination of %X parameters. In the Appearance
    Dialog you can specify the contents and visibility of these
    panels and the macro response "on click". In particular,
    specifying %!n displays the project file and
    [CMD("Open Project...")] is a possible macro response on
    clicks.

  - Split View: Splitters can be used to align certain controls on
  the left, right or bottom of the client area. In particular, the
  Project Tree and Gather Form which were previously displayed as
  "Stay on Top" forms can now be aligned on the side of the client
  Window and you can have them opened all the time (depending on
  the size of your monitor). The same goes for the Error Search
  Dialog which can be aligned at the bottom of the screen. To
  activate this alternative behavior please check the options in
  the Appearance Dialog (previously "Tool Bar Appearance").

  - Record and Play: You can start a Macro recorder to record a
  sequence of (simple) actions and then have them performed on the
  rest of the document. This can come handy when you want to
  perform a repetitive task on a large block. Macro recorder does
  not store your actions as a sequence of "low-level" shortcuts
  but converts them in a simple Macro Script. This script can be
  edited, and saved or used as a start point for a more
  sophisticated macro containing "intelligent" loops and
  conditional "statements". Recorder is implemented as a special
  GUI control aligned on the right in the client area. Buttons can
  be used to Stop/ Continue the recording session, play/ load/
  edit or save the recorded macro, etc... The recorded script is
  constantly being updated in the visible list box. Try it it is
  quite intuitive!

  A new Main Menu Item (Macros) has been introduced to accommodate
  the Macro recording commands. You can also save frequently
  performed recordings and define them as Macro menu Items in the
  new menu...

  - In the Appearance Dialog you can now specify the use of
  the background color for text. If this option is enabled it is
  possible to see the "trailing spaces" which are otherwise
  invisible. The color specified as the background for the custom
  color #15 in the Preferences| Colors Dialog is used for this
  purpose...

  - In the Appearance Dialog you can now specify the ".wav" files
  that can be used for sound effects when WinEdt displays
  different messages. By default the sounds assigned through the
  Windows control panel are used but if you have your favorite
  effects on your system you can now use them. Note that you
  can also disable (certain or all) sound effects...

  - In the Appearance Dialog you can now specify if the names in
  Document Tabs should include the filetype or not.

  - The Appearance Dialog now allows you to specify the size of
  the font used in the Status Line and Document Tabs as well as
  the format of the Date and Time that is optionally displayed in
  the Status Line. The GetDate macro function now allows you to
  specify the format of the date (see the description in
  Doc/Macros.txt for the syntax of date and time specification).

  - A new ability to define the lines that should not be
  formatted: in Settings Dialog you can now specified strings that
  prevent wrapping of a line if they are positioned at the end of
  line or anywhere inside. For example \\ and \\? prevents
  wrapping of lines ending with \\ or \\[1pt]. This extends the
  previous functionality where only the beginning of a line was
  examined to determine if a line should serve as a "paragraph"
  break. This is a minor enhancement to WinEdt's wrapping (the
  rest will be coming soon)...

  - Highlighting attributes now allow the specification of the
  background color combined with the font color and attributes. It
  is also possible to highlight certain columns (eg. for Fortran
  Mode)...

  - Highlighting in Modes with plenty of reserved words has been
  accelerated by the factor of 10-20 times. If you've experienced
  annoying visual flickering effects related to highlighting of (a
  few times hundred) reserved words you'll notice a drastic
  reduction in flickering...

  - Switches now allow a specification of two strings. This makes
  it possible to highlight environments such as
    \begin{equation}
       ....
    \end{equation}
  by specifying "\" as the filter set for Begin and End and use
  "begin{equation}" and "end{equation}" as the string
  delimiters...

       It has been suggested (and admittedly it makes sense) that
       Regular Expressions should be allowed in the Highlighting
       Schemes and Active Strings: there are a few problems
       related to the speed of WinEdt's RegEx evaluation and
       representation which would significantly affect the screen
       flickering and the memory consumption. I'll do something
       about it in one of the future releases...

  - Keyboard translation now allows "String->String" table
  (very rarely needed)

  - In Preferences| Font Dialog you can specify two different
  shapes for the Caret (one for the Insert Mode and the other one
  for Overwrite).

  - A different comment can be defined for each Mode (eg. % for TeX
  and "//" for C, etc...).

  - The "Word Count" Command has been implemented...

  - The "Send Mail" Command has been implemented...

  - The "Next/ Previous" Difference Command can now Highlight the
  position where a difference is found and can skip through the
  difference until the next identical lines are encountered. See
  the new options in the Compare Documents Dialog...

  - The Replace Dialog's Context Popup Menu (click with the right
  mouse button in dialog's client area) has a new Option: "Quick
  Replace". When this option is enabled the screen refresh is
  turned off in case of multiple replacement with no confirmation
  ("Replace All"). This can make the replace MUCH faster...

  - Environments for which spell checking is enabled or disabled
  can now be nested. For example, in TeX Mode it is now possible
  to configure Spell environments as follows:
     $$
       zzz not checked
       \text{zzz check here $zzz don't check$ zzz check again}
       not checked zzz
     $$

  - In Dictionary Manager there is a new set of options previously
  only available through the Context menu in the Word Suggestions
  Dialog. A new option "Center Lines Containing Misspelled Word"
  determines whether or not the line containing a word for which
  suggestions or completions are to be compiled is centered in the
  screen (some users found centering disturbing: - they should
  disable this option).

  - The Option "Immediately Execute Global Substitutions" (in
  Dictionary Manager| Options Dialog) instructs WinEdt to perform
  the global substitution for the whole document when the
  suggestions dialog was displayed in response to the misspelled
  word. A bug with capitalization and multiple global
  substitutions has been fixed...

  - A new String parameter
    %[/][~]("<filename>");
    Prefix is applied after the string parameter is expanded!
    This makes it possible to pass the short filename of files
    associated with the Main file to 16-bit accessories (eg.
    DVIWIN).

  - A new String %\ expands to CR+LF  (End of Line)
    Can come handy in the Prompt macro function if you want to
    control the line breaks in the resulting Message box...

  - Strings Parameters for WinEdt Macro functions can be enclosed
  between any of the following characters (serving as quotes):
    ",',`,:,*,|
  This (somehow) eliminates the need to use repeated quotes for
  strings inside strings...

  - Three special menus (File, Windows, and Project) allow you to
  append the list of recently opened Files, Documents and
  Projects. If such menu ends with an "open" submenu that is not
  ended using the "Return" menu Item then the lists are placed at
  the bottom of such submenu rather than the menu itself. This
  makes it possible to "hide" such lists should you wish to do
  so...

  - The Preferences| Saving Dialog now has a series of Options
  that determine the way WinEdt detects (the change in) the
  Readonly Status of any of its opened documents. This options
  should be particularly useful in combination with RCS (Revision
  Control System) packages for WinEdt. For more information on RCS
  see the link on WinEdt's Downloads Page.

  - The field "Requires File" in Menu Setup now allows you to
  specify which files should and which files should not
  exists in order for the Menu Item to be enabled:

        ? OR
        * AND
        | AND NOT
        / OR NOT

      %P\%N.ps?%P\%N.eps  -- enabled if either .ps or .eps file exists
      %P\%N.ps*%P\%N.eps  -- enabled if both .ps and .eps files exist
      |%P\%N.ps           -- enabled if .ps doesn't exist

    The symbols "?*|/" above were chosen because they are not
    admitted in filenames and should suffice to specify any
    combination of such filters that may arise in practice...

  - It is now possible to specify the translation applied to the
  Error Log File (see Settings| Errors Dialog).

  - A new command line qualifier -V has been introduced:
         -V Starts WinEdt in Virgin Mode:
           The last project is not automatically opened and no
           files are immediately restored

           If you want to start WinEdt in such mode when browsing
           your computer with Windows Explorer set the Open action
           associated with file types you want WinEdt to Open as:

              ...\WinEdt.exe -V "%1"

           This is done in Windows Explorer| View| Folder
           Options| File types...

       To offer a wider range of options WinEdt now implements the
       following qualifiers:

                -P starts WinEdt with the Default Project

                -N starts WinEdt with a new project

                -0 do not restore previously opened documents

       For example if you want to do some non-project related editing/
       browsing but would like WinEdt to keep the history of opened files
       you can start WinEdt with -P -0 (rather than a more radical -V).

       In fact one may prefer to always start WinEdt with -P -0 and then
       choose a project from the list of recently opened projects (only
       if one is in the working mood:-).


New Commands
============

  Word Count
  Send Mail

  New Project
  Open Project...
  Save Project
  Save Project As...
  Close Project
  Quit Project

  Record Macro
  Play Macro Once
  Play Macro
  Repeat Macro
  Repeat Last Command

  Insert Command
  Insert Macro
  Insert Parameter

  Go To Screen Top
  Go To Screen Bottom

The commands:

  Upper Case
  Lower Case

were incorrectly defined with 2 spaces between words. This has
been corrected. However, if you have a macro using eg.

  CMD('Lower  Case');

it will no longer work in the new version. You have to remove the
extra space (which was a source of plenty of confusion in the
previous version).


  - WinEdt16 allows you to define GUI and "List" interfaces:
  Dialogs containing custom buttons or List Box Items associated
  with macro commands. In WinEdt32 the GUI dialogs were replaced by
  the GUI Page Control. However, occasionally a need for List Box
  Interface (providing you a selection of predefined macros) may
  still arise. That's why the "List" interface functionality has
  been re-introduced. If you didn't miss such functionality you're
  probably not interested in it...

    Simple Example (of no practical use):
    =====================================

        Interface("New Document");
        //Caption

         Item("New","CMD('New')");
            // List Item
            // Macro to be executed

         ShowList(1,1,"","");
           // Execute on DblClick
           // Close on DblClick
           // Macro to be executed on OK
           // Macro to be executed on Cancel
           // Macros are redundant if DblClick response is enabled
           // Something like:  "Do('%%?')" could be specified as an OK
           // Action if the first parameter is 0 (%? expands to the
           // macro associated with the selected item

        End;


New or extended macros:
=======================

 AddDictionary("Name","File","Filter", Enabled,Load,Save,Add,Completion: 0..1);
  Add the dictionary to the list of WinEdt's Dictionaries in the
  Dictionary Manager Dialog. If the dictionary exists then it
  updates its properties.

 RemoveDictionary(");
  Removes the specified dictionary from the list of dictionaries.

 RefreshAll;
  Refreshes all document windows (may be necessary after adding a
  dictionary).

 ResetGDI("Mode");
  Makes sure that GDI (Gather) control displays tab pages relevant
  to the current mode. One can optionally specified mode to
  suppress current value which depends on your main document or
  current document...

 Exe("Macro File Name", "Default Directory");
   Opens the specified Macro File and interprets it as a sequence of
   WinEdt's Macro Commands (see ".edt" file in Macros Directory).
   If the filename is empty the Open dialog starts in the
   specified Default Directory allowing you to choose the file
   from the existing macro scripts...

 GetDate(StrRegister: 0..9; "Format");
   Now allows you to specify format of the output string.

       This macro provides an interface to FormatDateTime function.
       The function takes current date and time and formats it as
       specified by the user in the "Format" parameter. The results is
       available in the local register %!0..%!9. If the Optional
       "Format" parameter is omitted or left empty then the function
       returns the previous value which (in English) is equivalent to
       the format:

            'dddd, mmmm d, yyyy "at" hh:nn'

            Tuesday, September 1, 1998 at 16:49

        FormatDateTime formats the date-and-time value using the
        format given by Format. The following format specifiers are
        supported:

        c       Displays the date using the format given by the
                ShortDateFormat global variable, followed by the time
                using the format given by the LongTimeFormat global
                variable. The time is not displayed if the fractional
                part of the DateTime value is zero.

        d       Displays the day as a number without a leading zero (1-31).

        dd      Displays the day as a number with a leading zero (01-31).

        ddd     Displays the day as an abbreviation (Sun-Sat) using the
                strings given by the ShortDayNames global variable.

        dddd    Displays the day as a full name (Sunday-Saturday) using
                the strings given by the LongDayNames global variable.

        ddddd   Displays the date using the format given by the
                ShortDateFormat global variable.

        dddddd  Displays the date using the format given by the
                LongDateFormat global variable.

        m       Displays the month as a number without a leading zero (1-12).
                If the m specifier immediately follows an h or hh
                specifier, the minute rather than the month is
                displayed.

        mm      Displays the month as a number with a leading zero (01-12).
                If the mm specifier immediately follows an h or hh
                specifier, the minute rather than the month is
                displayed.

        mmm     Displays the month as an abbreviation (Jan-Dec) using the
                strings given by the ShortMonthNames global variable.

        mmmm    Displays the month as a full name (January-December) using
                the strings given by the LongMonthNames global variable.

        yy      Displays the year as a two-digit number (00-99).

        yyyy    Displays the year as a four-digit number (0000-9999).

        h       Displays the hour without a leading zero (0-23).

        hh      Displays the hour with a leading zero (00-23).

        n       Displays the minute without a leading zero (0-59).

        nn      Displays the minute with a leading zero (00-59).

        s       Displays the second without a leading zero (0-59).

        ss      Displays the second with a leading zero (00-59).

        t       Displays the time using the format given by the
                ShortTimeFormat global variable.

        tt      Displays the time using the format given by the
                LongTimeFormat global variable.

        am/pm   Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh
                specifier, and displays 'am' for any hour before noon,
                and 'pm' for any hour after noon. The am/pm specifier
                can use lower, upper, or mixed case, and the result is
                displayed accordingly.

        a/p     Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh
                specifier, and displays 'a' for any hour before noon,
                and 'p' for any hour after noon. The a/p specifier can
                use lower, upper, or mixed case, and the result is
                displayed accordingly.

        ampm    Uses the 12-hour clock for the preceding h or hh
                specifier, and displays the contents of the
                TimeAMString global variable for any hour before noon,
                and the contents of the TimePMString global variable
                for any hour after noon.

        /       Displays the date separator character given by the
                DateSeparator global variable.

        :       Displays the time separator character given by the
                TimeSeparator global variable.

        'xx'/"xx" Characters enclosed in single or double quotes are
                displayed as-is, and do not affect formatting.

        Format specifiers may be written in upper case as well as in lower
        case letters--both produce the same result.

 StartWorking("Panel Text");
   Changes the shape of the cursor to hour glass and displays the
   specified string parameter in the status line (user-friendly
   macros).

 StopWorking;
   Restores the Cursor Shape and clears the working string in the
   status line.

 MatchDelimiter(SelectionMode: 0..15, Delay: 0..1);
   A Macro interface to the Match Delimiter Command with optional
   parameters. The Selection Mode should normally be 1 and the Delay
   can be normally turned off inside macros (but not necessarily
   in the interactive version of the command where one might be
   interested to see what exactly is being matched).

 Beep(#0..4);
   Displays one of the sounds as defined in Appearances| Sound
   Dialog (0=Beep, 1=Information, etc...)

 SelPar(Paragrpah: 1..16000000, SelMode: 0..15);
   The same as SelLine except in the Soft Wrapping Mode where it
   selects the "real" line (as seen from the outside) which when
   wrapped may appear as a paragraphs.

 McrLoadFromFile("FileName.edt");
   Loads a pre-existing macro from a file to the Record and Play
   control (Open dialog if the string is empty).

 McrSaveToFile("FileName.edt");
   Saves the current recording from the Record and Play
   control to a file (Save As dialog if the string is empty).

 ShellExecute("Action","File","Parameters","Initial Directory",ShowFlag: 0..);
   A powerful interface to Windows ShellExecute function.
     Action: open, print or explore
     File: a file that should be opened
     Parameters: usually none or else filetype and application specific
     Initial Dir: can be empty or else wherever you think it should be
     Show Flag: 0-Default, 1=ShowNormal

   For example ShellExecute("Open", "http://www.winedt.com");
   starts your default internet browser and connects it to WinEdt's
   Home Page. ShellExecute("Open", "%f", "", "%p"); Opens your
   current file with the applications associated with its file
   type (eg. a quick preview in your Internet Browser for ".html" files).

 InsertString("String", Append: #0..1);
   Inserts or Append a string in the selected block (a macro
   interface to the Insert String Command by default Alt+Right).

 RemoveString(", #0..1);
   Removes inserted or appended string from the selected block (a macro
   interface to the Remove String Command by default Alt+Left).

 ScrollUp(#1);
 ScrollDown(#1);
 ScrollLeft(#1);
 ScrollRight(#1);
   Simple commands that scroll your Window by a specified number of
   Chars or Lines (without moving the caret position inside a text).

 IfFileOlder("File1","File2","Then Macro","Else Macro");
   Executes one of the specifies macros depending on the
   modification stamp for the specified files. True if File1 is
   older than File2. Assumes that both files exist (use the IfFileExists
   macro to decide what to do if one of the files does not exist)...

 IfOK("Then Macro","Else Macro");
 SetOK(isOK: 0..1);
 WhileOK("Macro");
   These functions are intended to implement macros that terminate
   once the action fails (eg. a string was not found, or the
   command line up was executed when at the beginning of the
   document). However, it is rather tricky to find all the places
   and exceptions where the OK indicator should be turned off.
   I'll try to go through the code carefully and maintain the OK
   flag accordingly but it may take some time before this idea
   becomes useful... IfOK should work with most macro functions
   (but not necessarily all the commands and CMD calls).

 Popup("Popup Menu Name","Popup Menu Item",Visible:-1..1);
   Same as Menu except that WinEdt executes the command associated
   with the specified Popup Menu's Item.

   If the second parameter is empty then the macro activates the
   specified Popup Menu. Visibility of the Popup can be enforced
   or prevented by setting the Visibility parameter to 1 or -1,
   respectively (only applies when the second parameter is empty).

 SetTracking(#0..1);
   Some users wrote advanced macros which were running very slow
   because WinEdt was refreshing the screen after every change. It
   is now possible to turn tracking off and thus speeding up such
   macros. However, if you forger to turn Tracking Back again
   WinEdt may be a little confused and the arrows will appear no
   longer to work. In such case just press ESC for a second to
   restore tracking...

   Note that the Replace Dialog has an option for Quick Replace in
   its context popup menu. It has the same effect: it temporarily
   turns screen refreshing off while performing Replace All...

 SetCaption("WinEdt's Title");
   You can now reset the Application Title through this Macro
   function (by default WinEdt).

 SetLogFilename("Log File");
   For different compilers one may want to change the log-file
   name as specified in the Settings| Errors Dialog. Now it can be
   done on the run.

 SetLogTranslation("Translation Table");
   Specify the translation table used when reading the log file
   into the Error Dialog.

 ShowErrorLog(Visible: 0..2);
   Shows Error Dialog (0-hide, 1-show, 2-toggle visibility)
   In WinEdt the Error dialog is by default aligned at the
   bottom of the client window.

 CopyToClipboard("String", Append: 0..1);
   Inserts or appends a string into Windows Clipboard in Text
   format.

 OpenPrj("ProjectFile.prj", RestoreDocuments: -1..1);
    Opens WinEdt's project file and (optionally) restores opened
    documents (No=-1, Default=0, Yes=1).

 SavePrj("ProjectFile.prj");
   Save the current project to a ".prj" file.

 SendToDOS("DOS Window Caption","Command");
   With this macro function it is possible to run a permanent
   console window and send the commands to be executed there.

   The following macro compiles and previews a LaTeX document:

   SetFocus("MS-DOS Prompt");
   SendToDOS("MS-DOS Prompt", "cd ""%P""%\latex --src %N%\yap -1 %N%\");

   %\ is a line separator (CR+LF)

   Note that by skipping the SetFocus everything happens in the
   background.

   This macro was suggested by Leva and is intended for advanced users
   with programming skills. It is possible that on some systems
   there are problems or resource leaks with it. WinEdt sends the
   (already running) DOS Window the wm_DROPFILES Windows message
   with a globally allocated command line(s) string  as a parameter.
   DOS interprets this as a sequence of command lines and executes
   them consecutively (as if they were pasted in the console window).
   WinEdt deletes the memory after the message is processed by a
   DOS Window...

The following Macros have been implemented to allow advanced users
to manipulate strings inside macros. They have not been
extensively tested so use them with care and report any problems:

 GetLength(Reg: 0..9, "String");
   Put the length of String in Reg.

 ExtractByIndex(Reg: 0..9, "String", Start:0, End:0);
   Put the substring of String between Start and End (where String
   is considered to have a zero-based index) into Reg

 InsertByIndex(Reg: 0..9, "S1", "S2", Index:0);
   Insert S2 into S1 starting at Index and put the result
   into Reg.

 FindInString("S1", "S2", Start, End:0..9, Flags, Resume:0);
   Put the start index of the first occurrence of S2 in S1 into
   Start (a register), the end index into End (a register).
   Flags allow the user to specify the search method:
        0: default
        1: search using regular expressions
       10: case-sensitive search
      100: backward search
     1000: begin searching at Resume index.  (This allows one
           to repeatedly search the same string for multiple
           occurrences of the same substring, etc.)
   The flags are chosen so that they may be specified as
   follows:
     1100: begin searching backwards through S1 starting at
           at Resume.
     0101: Backward search using regular expressions.

 ReplaceInString("S1", "S2", Start, End, Flags:0, Result:0..9);
   Replace the string between Start..End in S1 with S2
   and store the result in the %!<Result> register
   Usually called after FindInString ifOK
   Flags:  0 - default
           1 - Regular Expression
          10 - Respect Capitalization

 FormatString("String", Reg:0..9, "format");
   Perform the specified conversion to String and put the
   result in Reg.

   Formats are specified through the following keywords:

        "": default -- no conversion
        "whitespace": remove repeated whitespace between words
        "uppercase" : MAKE UPPERCASE
        "lowercase" : make lowercase
        "trimleft" : trim all whitespace on the left of the string
        "trimright" : trim all whitespace on the right of the string
        "trimboth" : obvious

   so, if %!9 = "  foo  bar  ",
   Convert("%!9", 9, "uppercase") = "  FOO  BAR  "
   Convert("%!9", 9, "whitespace") = "  foo bar  "
   Convert("%!9", 9, "trimleft uppercase") = "FOO  BAR  "
   etc.

-----------------------------------

WinEdt has a new Tab Page in the Settings Dialog called Wrapping.
It is intended for those that prefer a more conventional style of
wrapping where they are in charge of Returns while the editor can
temporarily wrap the lines with respect to the Window size. It is
now easy to impose such wrapping for all documents through this
dialog. In this Soft wrapping mode WinEdt never inserts any line
terminators and it is possible to wrap and unwrap a document by
clicking on the WRAP panel in the status line.


More on the new Project Management:
-----------------------------------

If you want to associate .prj files to open WinEdt projects after
being double-clicked you should associate the following Open
action with .prj (WinEdt Project) files:

  ...\WinEdt.exe -V "[OpenPrj(|%1|,1)]"

Note that I am using | as a string delimiter in the file
specifications because Windows strips parameters of double-quotes
and (unlike a bar) single quotes could be a part of the filename,
eg.:

  ...\my mother's recipies.prj

-V prevents any previous project to be opened and immediately
closed if a new instance of WinEdt is about to be started.


Here is the info on OpenPrj macro function:

 OpenPrj("ProjectFile.prj", RestoreDocuments: -1..1);
    Opens WinEdt's project file and (optionally) restores opened
    documents (No=-1, Default=0, Yes=1).

This macro also allows you to create a project-specific Icons
(shortcuts to WinEdt.exe) -- just follow the above example placing
the actual project filename instead of %1...

____________________________________________________________________


Build: 19991013 is now available. Below is the list of the new
features and fixes.

Let me first answer a few questions that I am receiving in large
quantities.

There are several reasons why work on WinEdt 5 is going slowly
(compared with a much more bold releases of previous versions):

1. I would like to make it easy to upgrade: users that are not
interested in the new features (and believe me there are plenty of
those who have contacted me with such concerns) will benefit from
bug fixes and optimization in WinEdt 5 while having all their
custom settings preserved. I'll prepare a separate "upgrade"
version for such users and make sure that everything goes
smoothly.

2. I am receiving over 20 reports, feature requests and support
questions (not necessarily related to WinEdt) and addressing such
e-mails this is taking over four hours of my programming time per
day. In fact, my backlog folder has over 200 unanswered e-mails
and it is becoming more and more obvious that I won't be able to
catch up. I am forced to focus on bug reports, leaving feature
requests for later and possibly ignoring non-WinEdt related
support questions.

3. I have to update the on-line documentation with all the new
features in WinEdt 5. In fact a need for a printable WinEdt manual
is becoming more and more obvious and I'll have to do something
about it before embarking on more features...

4. The list of improvements in WinEdt 5 does not necessarily
reflect the effort that went into it. Bug fixes and numerous speed
improvements have been implemented behind the scene. I spent a lot
of time organizing all the new options in a comprehensible manner
(rather than just throwing new check-boxes in dialogs and letting
things go out of control).

The official release of WinEdt is now a year old and it is really
important for the future of this project that WinEdt 5 gets
released within a month. That's why I am once again asking you for
patience with feature requests and limit your reports to bugs that
you have observed in the alpha version...


Changes from build (19991004):
==============================

In Preferences| Project dialog you can now specify the extension
of WinEdt project files (the default .prj is recommended).

The (Read) translation table can now be specified for the log file
as displayed in the Errors Dialog.

There is now a button and popup menu command "Reset GDI" which
resets the pages according to your current mode as well as a new
macro function ResetGDI("Mode"); does a similar thing with
optionally specified mode.

A bug with pasting a large string in the middle or the end of the
paragraph with wrapping turned on is now fixed (a part of
paragraph could be lost doe to an error in an (over)-optimized
WinEdt code).

 AddDictionary("Name","File","Filter", Enabled,Load,Save,Add,Completion: 0..1);
  Add the dictionary to the list of WinEdt's Dictionaries in the
  Dictionary Manager Dialog. If the dictionary exists then it
  updates its properties.

 RemoveDictionary("Name");
  Removes the specified dictionary from the list of dictionaries.

 RefreshAll;
  Refreshes all document windows (may be necessary after adding a
  dictionary).

 ResetGDI("Mode");
  Makes sure that GDI (Gather) control displays tab pages relevant
  to the current mode. One can optionally specified mode to
  suppress current value which depends on your main document or
  current document...

 IfFileOlder("File1","File2","Then Macro","Else Macro");
   Executes one of the specifies macros depending on the
   modification stamp for the specified files. True if File1 is
   older than File2. Assumes that both files exist (use the IfFileExists
   macro to decide what to do if one of the files does not exist)...

 SetLogTranslation("Translation Table");
   Specify the translation table used when reading the log file
   into the Error Dialog.

 ShowErrorLog(Visible: 0..2);
   Shows Error Dialog (0-hide, 1-show, 2-toggle visibility)
   In WinEdt the Error dialog is by default aligned at the
   bottom of the client window.



Changes from build (19991007):
=============================

A bug with appending "odd" extensions in save as dialog when the
specified file-type was not one of the declared ones in the dialog
has been fixed. Note that this bug only affected you if you have
the option "Append Extension" in Preferences| Include Dialog
Enabled. The problem was that Windows Save As Common Dialog acts
oddly when given a default extension parameter (..tex was appended
by the common dialog rather than WinEdt). Now WinEdt takes care of
appending the default extension (only when the file is opened in
the Mode associated with the specified default extension and the
above option is enabled and NO extension was specified in the Save
As dialog). Most users (me being one of them) may prefer to have
no appending done by WinEdt and this is done by disabling the
above mentioned option.

The following two macros were added for additional control over
this behavior:

 SetDefExt("File Type");
 SetAppendDefExt(Append: 0..1);


The Project Dialog now allows you to specify macros OnOpen and
OnClose that are executed when the project is opened or closed.
This makes it possible to redefine WinEdt's appearance and
behavior when opening projects dealing with different types of
files (eg. TeX vs. HTML, etc...).


The macro IfMode proved rather useless since the mode could be
compared as a string directly (using ifStr('%!m'...) macro).
That's why a new function

 IfisMode("Document Mode","Mode or Submode", "Then","Else");

has been introduced. It returns true if the specified Mode or
Submode is a part of Document Mode. Document Mode can be specified
as %!m or %!M for the current or main document (respectively).


For the sake of consistency the following macro functions have
been added to implement the Import/ Export functionality for
highlighted columns:

 AddColumns(");
 DelColumn(");
 LoadColumns(");
 ExtractColumns(");


NEW: WinEdt's Macro language has been extended to allow
user-defined local variables (rather than only the predefined
registers). The parameter:


 %$('local variable')

expands to the value assigned to the local variable or an empty
string if the variable is not defined or no value has been
assigned to it. Users can define up to 1000 local variables (but
in reality a few will do). This makes it possible to store some
information without relying on other macros not to overwrite the
value of a local register. The names of variables are case
sensitive and can consist of any string.


The following macro functions can be used to manipulate local
variables:

 Declare("Name");
 Release("Name");
 Assign("Name","Value");

Release('') erases all local variables. Assign can be used even if
the variable was not previously declared (it gets declared on
spot).

This makes it possible to declare variables (such as the one
pointing to the drive on which WinEdt is installed) in the Startup
Macro and then use them in your definitions as eg.

  %$('Base Drive');



Changes from Build (19991013)
=============================

From the response regarding the Activate event in the aligned
Gather Form it became clear that something has to be done about
it. I've explain technical difficulties that made the event
handler useless when the form is aligned. However, I've managed to
find a way around and now the OnActivate Macro (usually
GlobalMark) happens when the Gather Control is Activated.
Actually, that's almost true: the macro gets executed if any item
in the gather list is clicked and in the meantime the focused
document or the position within it has changed as a consequence of
a keyboard command or macro (not associated with the Click or
Double-Click event in the Gather Form). In any case, this should
solve the oddities with Double-click response inserting citations
to an unexpected place and establish the behavior compatible with
the non-aligned forms. The buttons Global Mark and Global Return
in the Gather Form remain to give you more manual control over the
position in your documents when "GDI Tracking" is enabled.

I've also changed the standard List control with the List View
control which displays hints when an item doesn't fit in the
Window (similarly to the Tree View). The Gather control
(especially TOC) looks better but the price is a 40KB (approx. 2%)
increase in the size of WinEdt's executable (nothing comes free).

A small change has been made with respect to readonly files: even
if automatic detection of readonly status is enabled (and Readonly
timer is ticking, eg. for the purpose of RCS) WinEdt preserves
those Readonly files that were explicitly opened as such through
the check-box in the Open Dialog. Furthermore, the check-box is no
longer present in some Open dialogs (eg. Execute Macro) where it
does not make sense.

Finally, a minor bug fix: WinEdt makes sure that the Status Line
and the Tool Bar reflect the current state with an infrequent
timer (just in case if something has escaped). This is fine.
However, if you enter the Tool Bar Setup WinEdt disabled buttons
associated with disabled menu items make it very hard to rearrange
the Tool Bar (one has an average of 5 sec. to move a button). This
is now fixed and Tool Bar buttons are left alone in the Tool Bar
Setup Mode...

______________________________________________________________________________


WinEdt 5 [Build 19991117 (beta)]
================================

Beta Release, the new Default Settings, and Upgrading Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------


Help has been updated to reflect most of the changes since the
official release of WinEdt32.

Slightly modified message processing which should address the
(unusual) problem with Kernel32 crash when opening or closing the
project files- I don't think this is a bug in WinEdt but I failed
to trace it to any specific Windows dll...

A few (very minor) reported bugs have been fixed and further speed
improvements have been made (eg. the Build Tree command is now
faster).

The need for the following Macros has arisen when preparing
different configurations for WinEdt:

  SetDefMode("Mode");
  SetDefPath("Path");
  SetInitLang(0..1);
  SetDefColors;
  SetVirginStart;


The main focus has been on preparing the default setup for this
beta version of WinEdt 5. Import/ Export macros have been around
since the last release of WinEdt32 but only a few users realized
their power when it comes to preparing and sharing WinEdt
configurations or making smooth upgrades while preserving those
private settings that took some effort to prepare. To illustrate
how this can be done, WinEdt's Options Menu now contains a
Configurations Submenu with the following basic configurations:

  Default (MiKTeX+Default Settings)
  ASCII Editor   - Basic WinEdt's menu and Tool Bar
  HTML  Editor   - Basic WinEdt's menu and Tool Bar suitable for
                   HTML Mode (without a flavor of TeX)

  MiKTeX Default - MiKTeX's Accessories and Help Menu and Tool Bar
  MiKTeX Direct  - same as MiKTeX except that TeX is called
                   directly (rather than through the Batch Files)
                     Works even if the PATH does not contain
                     MiKTeX's Bin Folder
  YandY TeX      - Basic configuration for Y&Y TeX System

These menu commands execute macros in the corresponding folders
inside the Config directories. These macros, in turn, update
certain WinEdt menus, change the Tool Bar, and set a few task
specific parameters.


IMPORTANT: After you customize WinEdt you SHOULD run the
Configurations| Backup Macro even if you don't plan to play with
any other configurations! This will save you a lot of problems if
anything goes wrong with your configuration. Of course, you can
make more than one setup (just follow the examples in the Config
directories).


There really isn't much to this and it does not take an expert to
prepare or modify such configurations. The macro that defines
MiKTeX's Mode looks like:

__________________________________________________________________

//MiKTeX Setup for WinEdt

    Requires(19991101);  //Build number (About Dialog)

    SetCPPErr(0, 0, ""); // C-style Errors: Off

    SetDefExt(".tex");
    SetDefMode("TeX");
    SetDefPath(!"%P");

    ExtractMenus('_Main Menu.dat');     // Backup the Menus
    ExtractToolBar('_Tool Bar.dat');    // Backup the Tool Bar

    SetCaption(' WinEdt/MiKTeX');       // Caption
    AddMenus('MiKTeX Default.dat');     // Accessories: MiKTeX Indirect
    LoadToolBar('Tool Bar.dat');        // Tool Bar
    LetStr(0,'--src');                  // Enable SRC Specials

End;
__________________________________________________________________


The key functions are AddMenus and LoadToolBar. These two
functions use DATA files that were created by first extracting the
appropriately defined Tool Bar and Menu by the ExtractMenus and
ExtractToolBar macros. The file "MiKTeX Default.dat" has been then
edited (as an ASCII/DATA file in WinEdt) to include only those
menus that are (MiK)TeX specific: Insert, Accessories and Help.

You can quickly try other configurations (eg. HTML or ASCII) and
see how the above mentioned Menus Change and how the Tool Bar is
modified to include only the buttons relevant to the current
configuration...

Note that the folder "...\Config\Backup" contains two macros
"_Backup.edt" and "_Restore.edt". These two macros can be executed
through the associated commands in the Options| Configurations
Menu. If you perform any changes to WinEdt you may want to run
Backup and thus make it possible to restore your custom settings
with a single command. This will make your future WinEdt upgrades
easy, allowing you to check out the new appearance and features of
WinEdt and then restore (some of) your settings. In particular,
you may want to selectively restore only those components that you
have extensively customized (eg. Translation Tables, Dictionaries,
Defaults, Modes, Active Strings, Templates, etc...). When it comes
to the menu you may want to add your custom menus or merge them
with the ones that come with the new release, thus taking
immediate advantage of any new functionality that has been added
to WinEdt. Note that a complete Restore takes a few seconds, while
a selective configuration macros (such as the predefined ones)
work very fast because they only modify the selected components.
Users that are concerned about their custom settings should
definitely take a look at the existing configuration macros and
".dat" files and prepare similar scripts for their own needs.
While testing such macros it is a good idea to make a backup copy
of your WinEdt.ini (just in case something goes wrong!).

Note that WinEdt also provides user-defined Event Handlers for:

  MDI Activate - when a new document window gets focus
  Project Open
  Project Close
  WinEdt Startup
  WinEdt Exit

This makes it possible to call a project-specific configuration
macro when a project is opened, thus making sure that WinEdt is
properly configured... Advance users can consider taking advantage
of such functionality. To avoid performing configuration in a case
when WinEdt is already configured for the task, one can use global
registers, store the name of the current configuration, and
execute the macro only if needed (thus reducing the unwanted
flickering).

------------------------

A note on Startup Macro:

By default the Startup Event calls "...Config\Startup.edt" macro.

This macro defines certain variables that are used in WinEdt's
menus:

______________________________________________________________________________

// WinEdt Startup Macro

// You can modify this file and restart WinEdt to reflect
// any characteristics specific to your (TeX) system...

// Get MiKTeX Install Root Directory from the Windows Registry

  Assign("MiKTeX-Root","%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','MiK','MiKTeX','CurrentVersion','MiKTeX','Install Root');");
  Assign("MiKTeX-Bin","%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','MiK','MiKTeX','CurrentVersion','MiKTeX','Install Root');");

  IfStr("%$('MiKTeX-Bin')","",">",>
    !"Assign('MiKTeX-Bin','%$(''MiKTeX-Bin'');\miktex\bin\')",>
    !"Assign('MiKTeX-Root','c:\texmf')"); // Try this but MiKTeX is probably not (properly) installed

  //YandY TeX Install Root Directory

  Assign("YandY","c:\yandy"); // Change this to your YandY TeX Install Root Directory...

  // TeX Accessories (optional)

  Assign('GSView','c:\gstools\gsview\gsview32.exe'); // Change this to your GSView executable
  Assign('AcroRead','C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe'); // Acrobat Reader

End;

______________________________________________________________________________


MiKTeX's Root directory (usually "c:\texmf") is obtained from
Windows registry. This makes it possible to define Help Items or
call MiKTeX's executables regardless of where MiKTeX has been
installed. For example:

MiKTeX's Help is defined in WinEdt's Menu as the following macro:

    WinHelp("%$('MiKTeX-Root');\doc\miktex\miktex.hlp");

Similarly, in the MiKTeX Direct configuration yap is called as:

    %$('MiKTeX-Bin');yap.exe -1 etc...

This should work even if MiKTeX's Bin directory is not on your
PATH (a very common problem that takes a lot of my
correspondence).

I have also decided to define GSView and AcroRd variables; thus
users that installed these programs in some other folder can
modify these entries and restart WinEdt without the need to modify
the menu (another commonly encountered problem that takes a large
part of my time).

Note that this macro takes advantage of the newly introduced local
variables "%$('variable') rather than the string registers which
can be used and overwritten by other macros.


The cleanup macro that is executed when WinEdt is closed by
default closes YAP (if running). You can modify it to do something
more intelligible...

______________________________________________________________________________


SRC packages have been simplified to avoid problems and unwanted
interactions with other packages. Since MiKTeX can insert the src
specials when started with --src qualifier the packages don't have
to be used or else they can be used as inactive (to take advantage
of the re-defined \include command that can keep track of input
files for Error Search from WinEdt). The samples included in the
default settings thus contain the following line in their
preamble:

    \usepackage[inactive]{srcltx}%SRC Specials for DVI Searching

In MiKTeX configuration the Accessories menu has two items:

    SRC Special On and Off

These items are defined as macros that assign or erase the value
"--src" for the %0 global string register. This works because by
default the LaTeX command is now defined as:

    %~B\Bin\MiKTeX\Latex.bat %0 "%N%T"

and %0 is expanded accordingly.

______________________________________________________________________________


MiKTeX's Folder in the default settings has been expanded with
dvipdfm and tth utilities. For more information on these utilities
please consult MiKTeX's Documentation (...texmf\Doc\...).

An enhanced version of HTML Mode as prepared by Denis Stancer has
now become a part of the Default, as well as (a more specialized)
HTML Configuration. Furthermore, I made an experiment and in the
Settings| Wrapping Dialog I defined Soft Wrapping for HTML files
(new feature). It appears to work fine and WinEdt's web pages have
been converted appropriately for such editing. Of course this can
be changed instantly by users that do not like such preferences by
changing the settings the above mentioned dialog.

A new menu Macros has been introduced to accommodate the new
Record and Play commands. Items "Execute Macro" and "Define and
Run Macro" has been introduced in this menu to allow you to
execute a predefined macro script (.edt file) or to type and run a
custom macro. Note that previously the "Execute Macro" menu item
had been placed in the (somewhat crowded) Accessories Menu.

In the default settings the File and Project Menu end with an
"open" submenu and thus the file list is appended there rather
than in the corresponding main Menu Item. You can change this by
appending the "Return" to the Submenu or deleting the submenu and
placing its contents in the main menu item. This choice is now
available due to the following extension of WinEdt's Menu
management functionality:

  - Three special menus (File, Windows, and Project) allow you to
  append the list of recently opened Files, Documents and
  Projects. If such menu ends with an "open" submenu that is not
  ended using the "Return" menu Item then the lists are placed at
  the bottom of such submenu rather than the menu itself. This
  makes it possible to "hide" such lists should you wish to do
  so...


The Tool Bar Buttons and Menu Icons have been improved and now
(hopefully) look more professional. In particular the Menu Icons
now no longer load a disabled image but generate one as needed.
Unfortunately, a few Tool Bar Images (a total of six of them) have
been (re)moved (their index in WinEdt.btn has changed) or replaced
with the new ones. The idea was to leave the last five images
undefined and thus allow users to use these buttons for their own
bitmaps without sacrificing compatibility with other
configurations. I suggest that you stick with the new scheme and
possibly copy any custom images in the new setup (modify the last
five buttons in Winedt.btn) and make a few changes in the Menu
Setup (if needed). However, if you are determined to stick with
your current configuration as it is you can simply copy your
current WinEdt.ini .btn .img and the whole Bitmaps folder over the
files in the new WinEdt 5 setup...


A known problem (and solution) with tool bars in dialogs:
=========================================================

If the Tool Bars in your Dialogs display no images this is due to
the obsolete version of your "comctl32.dll" in Windows System
directory. You should download and install a newer version from

   http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp

Here is a report from one of the users that had a similar problem:

>This is to confirm that in my case updating comctl32.dll did indeed
>solve the problem of missing bitmaps in the dialog buttons.
>
>The comctl32.dll causing the trouble was 371KB big and had date 22/03/97
>
>I found in Microsoft's site THREE different comctl32 updates:
>
>Com32upd.exe, which reported that the installed comctl32.dll was the
>same or newer.
>
>401comupd.exe, which I installed and solved the problem.
>
>50comupd.exe, which I did not try.
>
>I should add that I do not have Internet Explorer installed in this computer.

How to upgrade to WinEdt 5:
===========================


Depending on the importance of your custom settings there are a
few different options:

  (0) If you don't care for any new functionality (or you prefer
  to make additions to the menu yourself) you can start Setup.exe
  and choose the Custom Setup Install Shield Option. You can
  select only the Basic Upgrade component. This way only the
  executable is installed over the old version of WinEdt. However,
  to see the new appearance of bitmaps and menu you may want to
  try the steps (1) and (2) below. You should still be able to
  restore your current configuration by following the
  instructions below...

  (1) If you did not customize WinEdt extensively, exit WinEdt, rename
  the old WinEdt directory to WinEdt.old and install WinEdt 5 from
  scratch:
      - place a self extracting archive winedt5.exe to a temporary
      directory and double-click on it to unpack it
      - Go to the folder where you have unpacked winedt5.exe and
        double-click on the Setup.exe
      - Let install Shield guide you through the rest

  (2) If you did customize WinEdt perform the steps in (1)

       (a) you can radically move your old WinEdt.ini to the new
       installation and thus preserve all your previous settings
       while also not taking immediate advantage of any new
       features (you'll have to manually add the selected new menu
       items following the instructions in What's New).


       (b) you can start the old WinEdt and perform a backup of
       your configuration settings using the "_Backup.edt" macro
       in WinEdt's "...\Config\Backup" folder. Now you can
       selectively add only those components that you have
       extensively modified. Note that the AddMenu macro allows
       you to add only certain menus after you edit the "Main
       Menu.dat" file. Almost all components (eg. Translation
       Tables, Active Strings, Highlighting Schemes, etc...) can
       be exported and imported either from the corresponding
       dialogs or through the import/ export macros as described
       in WinEdt's "...\Doc\Macros.txt" document.

The Option (2) only applies if you have WinEdt32 Build 19981001
(or [yyyymmdd] later) installed on your system.


Both (a) and (b) may leave you with a few improperly assigned tool
bar buttons. You can, of course, copy your old Bitmaps folder
together with WinEdt.btn but this will make your configuration
incompatible with others. I would strongly recommend that you
manually correct your tool bar buttons and (in the Menu Setup
Dialog) assign the proper images to a few commands and accessories
that are affected by the changes made in the default setup. It
should only take a a few minutes to do so. After you've configured
WinEdt 5 to your standards you should run the "_Backup.edt" to
ensure that your setup can always be restored after some other
configuration is being executed (either on purpose or
accidentally). Making a backup of your private WinEdt.ini in
WinEdt's Config\Backup directory is also a good idea!


After WinEdt 5 is installed you should go through the dialogs in
the Options Menu to get a feeling how the Options and Preferences
are organized. Even if you are not planning to make any immediate
changes it is good to know what is there for later when you may
want to change something...

Some of the features described here are not yet a part of the
regular documentation or on-line help. Reading *this* file is
strongly recommended!

WinEdt 5 [Build 19991121 (beta)]
================================


A bug with refreshing long lines has been fixed. Sorry about that
(many users panicked because of it)!


Some users misunderstood the meaning of the new configuration
settings in the options menu and they overwrote their custom
settings. Here what you should know:

IMPORTANT: After you customize WinEdt you SHOULD run the
Configurations| Backup Macro even if you don't plan to play with
any other configurations! This will save you a lot of problems if
anything goes wrong with your configuration. Of course, you can
make more than one setup (just follow the examples in the Config
directories). The Options| Configurations| Restore command
restores your "last" backup!


If you've managed to overwrite your configuration without backing
it up you can still restore it immediately after you tried any
other pre-defined configuration by doing the following:

In the \Config subfolder where you have experimented with one of
the pre-defined settings there are two (backup) files "_Tool
Bar.dat" and "_Main Menu.dat". The following Macro restores the
settings if placed in the same directory and executed through
WinEdt's Macros| Execute Macro Command:

// Restore All Important Settings

    Requires(19991027);
    LoadMenus('_Main Menu.dat');
    LoadToolBar('_Tool Bar.dat');
End;


The status line now takes advantage of the second custom panel and
it toggles the --src specials qualifier for MiKTeX. You can easily
change or hide this panel through the Appearance|Status Line
Dialog. A new macro UpdateStatus has been introduced to make this
functionality work better (it refreshes the Status Line).
Additional macros for use in the configuration macros:
  SetPanelA(visible:0..1; "Max String","Parameter","On-Click Macro");
  SetPanelB(visible:0..1; "Max String","Parameter","On-Click Macro");

SetPanelB(1,'--src','%%0',>
   !|IfStr("%0","--src","=","LetStr(0,'')","LetStr(0,'--src')");UpdateStatus]|);

Does the trick.


The startup Macro now searches Windows registry to find GSView and
AcroRd32. This should work in most cases regardless of where are
the above utilities installed. The following macro does this:

  LetReg(0,|%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','CLASSES','psfile','DefaultIcon',' ');|);
  GetLength(1,|%!0|);
  ExtractByIndex(0, |%!0|, 0,%!1-3);
  Assign('GSView',|%!0|);

  //Prompt(|%$('GSView')|);  // Debugging

  IfStr("%$('GSView')","","=",>
    !"Assign('GSView','c:\gstools\gsview\gsview32.exe')"); // GSView not Installed?

  // Assign('GSView','c:\gstools\gsview\gsview32.exe'); // GSView


  LetReg(0,|%@('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE','SOFTWARE','CLASSES','Software','Adobe','Acrobat','Exe',' ')|);
  GetLength(1,|%!0|);
  ExtractByIndex(0, |%!0|, 1,%!1-2);
  Assign('AcroRead',|%!0|);

  //Prompt(|%$('AcroRead')|); // Debugging

  IfStr("%$('AcroRead')","","=",>
    !"Assign('AcroRead','C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe')"); // Acrobat Reader not Installed?

  // Assign('AcroRead','C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe'); // Acrobat Reader


If for some reason this does not work don't panic! Just Open the
Startup.edt file and enter the definitions:

  Assign('AcroRead','<your location>\AcroRd32.exe'); // Acrobat Reader

Similarly for GSView. Restart WinEdt or execute the Statup.edt
through the Macros| Execute Macro command. Let me know if you have
problems with the New Startup Macro (even if AcroRd32 and GSView
has been properly installed on your computer)...


Note that all this is irrelevant for users that upgraded WinEdt32
and kept their old WinEdt.ini file...


Help in the Settings Dialog explains the meaning of the new
options in the Wrapping Tab Page. You should read this information
if you want to take advantage of new wrapping options which were
introduced for users that prefer more word processor like
wrapping. And don't worry: the old wrapping is still there but you
may have to enable the option "Persistent Line Wrapping" in the
above mentioned dialog to ensure the "line wrapping" even if the
Wrapping is turned off in the Status Line...

Pre-release of WinEdt 5:
------------------------

WinEdt 5 [Build 20000222 (beta)]
================================


A few reported minor bugs (form the last official build 19991226)
have been fixed and the default settings have been slightly
improved (once again!).

The system-specific problems with some accessories and macros in
the default settings (such as PDFLaTeX.edt and AcroRd32.exe in
Startup.edt) have been addressed...

Improved GUI (including Tool Bar Buttons and GUI control as
modified and announced by Alexander Kiselov). To avoid problems
with small screens and low-color settings (in which case the
"improved" GUI isn't really an improvement) WinEdt detects such
settings when launched for the first time and uses the old GUI
bitmaps if the system does not meet the requirements (at least
800pxl horizontal resolution and 16-bit [or more] color scheme).
I've tested it my old computer and it appears to work as
intended...

The Project Manager now allows optional "relative file
specification" which makes it possible to carry the projects
between different folders, drives, or computers.

Conventional wrapping is a choice of many new users. WinEdt now
"intelligently" print such files. In fact, the printing dialog has
a new option "Word Wrapping" which instructs WinEdt not to break
lines blindly at the right paper margin...

The highlighting| Switches Dialog have been slightly re-designed
in an attempt to make it more intuitive. It does not, however,
implement any new functionality...

The gather form's List View control was too slow when a large
number of items were appended to it. In fact, the time for
(1000+) additions turned out to be of order "n^2" which is
unacceptable (out of principle). WinEdt now takes care of this by
representing the collected data in its own structures and this
makes it possible to insert many more items. The Tool Bar in the
Gather Form now has a button for Copy to the Clipboard which was
before only possible through the context popup menu. Furthermore,
while experimenting with collecting items in a large data base
I've discovered that some feedback might be needed when collecting
10K+ items: this is now taken care of.

*** NEW: WinEdt now comes with a configuration Wizard which is
displayed the first time the program is started and can later be
called through the Help| Configuration Wizard Command. It has a
selected set of option pertaining to Wrapping, Backup, Projects,
etc... The Wizard also contains a page that helps you fix any
(MiK)TeX related problems and suggests solutions and alternatives
(eg. MiKTeX Direct Configuration if the PATH does not contain
MiKTeX's Binary directory but MiKTeX can be detected from the
Windows Registry). There are also a few pages containing
(selected) answers to FAQs and explanations on "how to...". This
should (hopefully) make it easier for new users to understand how
WinEdt interacts with other accessories and how many minor
system-specific issues can be addressed and resolved.


The text in Wizard's Pages and WinEdt's Help needs some editing
and polishing. While processing the incoming reports I'll focus on
this aspect and (pending any major disasters) WinEdt 5 will be
finally released by the end of March. Many users are asking what
happened to the self-imposed January dead line: The answer is
that I simply cannot keep up with the feedback and I find it
extremely hard to draw a line. So once again, limit your reports
to WinEdt-related problems and save your suggestions for later.
WinEdt 5 is much better and problem/bug-free compared to the
official WinEdt32 and it is time to make it available to wider
audience on CTAN.

For those that are keen to have WinEdt improved further there will
be plenty of opportunities to speak out and test new features as
they become available in the new alpha and beta versions. The
majority, however, appears to prefer a stable release every 12
months rather than downloading permanent beta versions...

WinEdt 5 [Build 20000308 (v. 5.1)]
==================================

The following problems have been addressed for for Build 20000308:

- A (critical!) bug with scrolling in docked Gather form is fixed

- An error in macros for insertion of matrices and arrays have
been fixed (a missing ")"),

- WinEdt now allows more than one row of document tabs. There is
a new option in the Appearance| Tabs Dialog that controls this
behavior. The Tab control gets automatically re-sized. Although
with 50+ document tabs the control produces some visual
flickering when adding or removing new document tabs (depends on
your hardware) it can still come handy for users that want direct
access to a few dozen opened files (assuming they have a large
enough screen to use the upper space for 3 or 4 rows of document
tabs).

- Most WinEdt's Modal dialogs now center with respect to the Main
Form rather than the screen. Also the "Parent Font" inheritance
have been disabled in some dialogs to prevent odd alignment of
buttons in dialogs as experienced by users that use larger
default fonts...

- A minor problem with rearranging the tool bar and dropping the
buttons on the left edge has been fixed. This might have to do
with the two reported spaces on the left of the first button...

- In the Syntax Highlighting Dialog -> Columns, the heading says
Highligted columns (missing h): fixed...

- A bug with the ghost caret after scrolling by clicking on the
scroll bars is fixed.

- The email and www field in WinEdt's About box now respond to
clicks (made possible by the macros below and the ShellExecute
macro function)...

- The following new macro functions have been implemented:

  SetFolder("Path");
  SetEnvVar("Name","String Value");
  SetRegKey("KEY_...","Key1\Key2...","String Value");
  SetRegStr("KEY_...","Key1\Key2...","Strung Name","String Value");
  SetWinEdtRegStr("String Name","String Value");

  SendMail("Subject","Text","Recipients","Attachments");

  For example:
  ============

    SendMail('Test Message',"Attached is WinEdt.txt",>
      "WinEdt Team|support@winedt.com","%F|WinEdt.txt");

    You can specify more than one recipient or attachment
    (separate up to 1024 items by semi-columns ;)

    The second optional filename, following the bar |, is the one
    that the recipient sees...

    All parameters are optional and can be entered or modified
    once the e-mail client is started.

    If a recipient is preceded by "*" or "?" the massage is CC'd
    or BCC'd (respectively) to that address:

      "WinEdt Team|support@winedt.com;*Alex|alex@winedt.net"


IMPORTANT: The MAPISendFunction (and the rest of the MAPI
interface on which the default WinEdt's Send Mail command and
macro rely) does not work unless the Windows Registry contains
the string MAPI with value "1". This can be checked and set from
within WinEdt with:

  // Returns the value 1?
  %@("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE","SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem","MAPI");

  // Sets the value to 1
  SetRegStr("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE",>
    "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem", "MAPI", "1");

If WinEdt's Send Mail Command fails and WinEdt detects the
absence of the above Registry Entry the user is prompted to allow
WinEdt to add the value and restart the program. The lack of this
registry key indicates that your email client may not support
MAPI in which case the above fix won't make any difference.
However, in some cases it is possible that although your email
client has a sufficient MAPI functionality to allow WinEdt to
send email messages the registry was not appropriately modified
during its installation. The above fix will enable the MAPI
functionality (assuming that it is supported by your email
program). For example, the registry entry may have been deleted
when you uninstall some other email client that you are not using
(eg. Outlook Express)...
