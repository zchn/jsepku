-------------------------------------------------------------

WINDOWS:
===================================

  2. If AutoRun is enabled on your computer, installation
     will begin automatically.

  3. If AutoRun is not enabled, double-click on the
     My Computer icon.

       * Double-click on the CD-ROM icon.
       * Double-click on the file named SETUP (or SETUP.EXE).

  2. Double-click on the CD-ROM icon on the desktop.

  3. Double-click on the file named SETUP.

  4. Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.



-------------------------------------------------------------
    3. Upgrading from a Previous Version of the Software    
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from a Merriam-Webster reference that has
a version number lower than 2.5, it is recommended that you
completely uninstall (remove) the old version before installing
the new one.

If you do not want to remove the older version, you have
two options:


  1. Install your new software in a different folder/directory
     than the previous version.

  2. Install the new software into the same folder/directory
     as the previous edition.


If you choose option 1, your two Merriam-Webster references will
remain completely separate and you will access them as two
distinct programs. 

If you choose option 2 and install the new software into the
same directory/folder as the previous version, you will be able
to access all of your Merriam-Webster references from the same
program screen (that is, they will be integrated). (NOTE: This
option applies only to versions higher than 2.5).

If you select option 2, some files will be replaced, some new
files will be added, and some files from the previous version
will remain unchanged. If you later remove your Merriam-Webster
software from your computer, you may need to manually delete
some files from the version you had before obtaining version 3.0.

If you are upgrading from the Collegiate Dictionary, 10th Edition
to the Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition, the 11th Edition will
replace the 10th Edition in the list of available references that
appears in the program. However, if you wish to use both the 10th
and 11th editions, you can do so by taking the following steps: 


  1. Open My Computer or Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder
     where the dictionary is installed. Make sure the dictionary
     program is closed.

  2. Open the folder containing the dictionary and find the file
     named c10.dc_ .

  3. Rename that file c10.dct .

  4. Close My Computer or Windows Explorer and reopen the dictionary.
     The Collegiate Dictionary 10th edition should now appear in
     the list of available references.

If you have any difficulty restoring the Collegiate Dictionary. 10th
Edition to the list of available references, contact technical
support for assistance (technical support contact information
appears below).


-------------------------------------------------------------
        4. Where to Find More Detailed Instructions        
-------------------------------------------------------------
This ReadMe file provides basic instructions for using your new
electronic reference. The program itself includes other
information about how to get the most from it. Please check
the following documentation for detailed instructions.

  (1) HELP WITHIN THE PROGRAM:
      Merriam-Webster's electronic references include a built-in
      HELP system that contains answers to many questions you may
      have about using the program.

      To use the program's HELP system, click on the HELP menu and
      choose either "Contents and Index" (Windows), "Help contents"
      (Macintosh), or "Search" to locate information about using the
      program.

  (2) ON-SCREEN (ROLLOVER) HELP:
      As you move your cursor over parts of the program screen,
      messages appear in the status bar at the bottom of the 
      screen describing the feature where your cursor is located.
      Those messages also offer simple instructions about how to
      use the program's many features.

  (3) USER'S GUIDE:
      On the CD-ROM, you will find an electronic user's guide named
      guide.pdf  This printable user's guide can help you learn
      to use the program.

      The User's Guide includes a section called Explanatory Notes
      that describes the typographical conventions (e.g., boldface,
      italics, abbreviations) used in the text of your new Merriam-
      Webster reference.

      The user's guide is installed in the same directory or folder
      as the dictionary itself. If you have trouble finding it, use
      your computer's Search or Find tool to look for guide.pdf.

      You need Adobe's Acrobat(R) Reader software to open
      and use guide.pdf. A copy of the Adobe software is included
      on the CD with the dictionary program or you can download it
      free from Adobe's Web site at:

      http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.html .  

  (4) ONLINE FAQ:
      You can find a list of frequently asked questions related to
      this program on Merriam-Webster's Web site at:

      http://www.merriam-webster.com/service/collegiatefaq.htm . 


-------------------------------------------------------------
               5. Registering Your Dictionary               
-------------------------------------------------------------
Registering your CD-ROM product helps Merriam-Webster provide better
technical support and makes it possible for us to inform you of new
software developments. You can register online by selecting the
"Register This Product" option from the Go Online menu of your
Merriam-Webster reference. Note that you must have Internet
access and a Web browser (such as Netscape or Microsoft
Internet Explorer) to register online. The address of the Web
registration page is: 


http://www.Merriam-Webster.com/register.html .


-------------------------------------------------------------
          6. Screen Resolution and Color Settings                
-------------------------------------------------------------
Your screen resolution must be set to 800 x 600 or higher
for this program to function properly. On a computer using
Microsoft Windows, you can reset your screen resolution
by right-clicking on the Windows desktop and choosing
Properties from the menu that appears. Click on the
Settings tab in the dialog box and move the slider to the 
800 x 600 setting.

On a Macintosh computer, select the Monitors option from
the Control Panel to change your screen resolution.

To display all of the colors in the illustrations properly,
you must set your screen color depth to High Color or
thousands of colors.

-------------------------------------------------------------
                         7. Fonts                              
-------------------------------------------------------------
The special characters used to display information in the
Merriam-Webster dictionaries are included in four fonts that
come with this software. All four fonts should be installed
automatically with the program. However, if you start the
dictionary and see unexpected symbols or characters on the
screen, the fonts may not have installed properly or the computer
was not restarted after installation (on some Windows computers,
the fonts will load only after restarting).

If this occurs, you can manually reinstall the fonts; they
can be found in the folder named Fonts on the CD. On a Windows
computer, go to the Control Panel and use the Fonts icon to
open the Fonts dialog box. Find the Install New Font option
(it is usually in the File menu) and use it to install or
reinstall the fonts and then restart your computer.

On a Macintosh computer, drag the Merriam-Webster font
suitcase into the Fonts folder that is inside the System folder.


-------------------------------------------------------------
                8. Very Long Results Lists                   
-------------------------------------------------------------
Some searches in this Merriam-Webster program can produce
extremely long results lists. This program will automatically
truncate very long results lists (e.g., those that include
several thousand words) to prevent your computer from using too
many resources in attempting to display such long lists.

Try making your search more specific to obtain shorter
results lists.


-------------------------------------------------------------
                9. Using the Go Online Options                  
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Go Online menu gives you quick, easy access to a rich
variety of Merriam-Webster's online language resources
including Merriam-Webster OnLine, Merriam-WebsterCollegiate.com,
Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day, and Merriam-WebsterUnabridged.
To use the Go Online menu, click on it, then choose a Web site.

To use the Go Online menu, you must have an Internet
browser and an open connection to the World Wide Web.

Alternately, you can click on the Go Online button located
directly about the text display portion of the program screen
to visit Merriam-Webster's online resources.

In some cases, you may find that the Go Online options open
your Web browser, but it do not bring up the Web site
you want to see. This can happen for a variety of reasons
related to the setup and configuration of your browser
and computer. If this happens, you can still visit 
Merriam-Webster's online language sites by typing the
appropriate address from the list below into your browser
and clicking "Go."

        10. Removing (Uninstalling) This Software
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you decide to remove this software from your computer,
close all programs and restart the computer before attempting
to uninstall.

On a Windows computer, you may uninstall this program by using
the Add/Remove Programs feature. To use this feature, click
on the Start button, then select Settings, then Control Panels
(on XP, click Start, then Control Panels). Next, select
Add/Remove Programs and locate the Merriam-Webster listing in
the dialog box that appears.

If two Merriam-Webster listings appear (this may occur if you
upgraded from a previous version of the software), remove them
both.

On a Macintosh computer, rerun the Setup file and choose the
Uninstall option. 

All Merriam-Webster files, including the main program and macros,
should be removed when you uninstall. However, if some files
remain (again, this may happen if you upgrade from a previous
version), you can remove them manually by dragging them to the
Trash or Recycle Bin.

In some cases, you may receive a message indicating that some
files or folders are locked and cannot be removed. If this occurs,
restart your computer, then remove the files or folders by
dragging them to the Trash or Recycle Bin.


-------------------------------------------------------------
                   11. Technical Support
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you have questions about installing or using this product,
you may email our technical support staff at:

techsupport@merriam-webster.com

If you prefer, you can call 1-800-696-0514 between 7:00 a.m. and
6:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

-------------------------------------------------------------
               12. Overriding Windows AutoPlay               
-------------------------------------------------------------
This program takes advantage of the Windows AutoPlay feature
to make installation easier. If you wish to avoid having
AutoPlay start each time you insert the CD-ROM, hold down
the SHIFT key when you insert the CD.

-------------------------------------------------------------
             13. Macintosh Administrator Passwords             
-------------------------------------------------------------
Some versions of the Macintosh OS 10 software may require
you to enter a password to install new software. This may
occur if you did not set an Administrator password when you
configured your computer, or if you specified that only
an Administrator can install new software. If this occurs,
type your password and click OK to proceed. If you do not
know your password, try typing "merriam" (without the
quotation marks) and clicking OK. If that does not work, 
consult your Macintosh's documentation or speak to your System
Administrator for information on working with passwords.


-------------------------------------------------------------
       14. Installing Macros to Access Word Processors       
-------------------------------------------------------------
Macros are small companion programs included with this
program to make it easy to look up words from within your word
processor. The macros included in this program allow you to put
a dictionary lookup button on the toolbar of Microsoft(R) Word for
Windows 97, 2000, or XP. Macros are also available for 
Microsoft(R) Word for Macintosh 98, 2000 and X.

During installation, Merriam-Webster's software should automatically
detect which version of MS Word you have. If Word is detected, you
can choose where to install the macro (i.e., in the toolbar or
right-click menu); you may also elect not to install any macros. If
the installer cannot find a compatible word processor,
a screen will appear asking you to indicate where your word
processor is installed.

Consult the documentation that came with your word processor
to determine where its program files are installed.

If you decide you want to add the macros after installing
the program itself, you can manually install the macro of your
choice from the CD. To manually install a macro, insert the CD into
the appropriate drive of your computer, locate the folder named
"Macros," find the macro for your word processor, and double-
click on it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the
installation.

The macro installer will add a button to either the toolbar or
the context menu (i.e., the menu that pops up when you
right-click in a document). During installation, you can
specify where you want the button to appear. You can put macro
buttons in both locations if you wish.

After the macro button is installed and you have restarted your
computer, you can look up words from your word processor by
placing your cursor in a word and clicking the macro button. This
will bring up Merriam-Webster's software. If your Merriam-Webster
reference was open in the background before you clicked the
macro button, the word containing the cursor will be looked up
automatically. If it was not, click the macro button a
second time (after the dictionary opens) to look up the word.

NOTE: These macros are designed to work with the English-language
alphabet and may not operate properly with non-English character sets.

NOTE: If no macro button appears in the location you specified, even
after following the instructions in this Readme file, contact
technical support for assistance (see below for contact information).


-------------------------------------------------------------
     15. Linking Corel WordPerfect 10 to the Dictionary      
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you use Corel WordPerfect 10 and you would like to add a button
to the WordPerfect toolbar which sets up a quick link between
WordPerfect and your Merriam-Webster's reference, follow these
instructions:

  1. In WordPerfect 10, choose Settings from the Tools menu.

  2. Click the Customize button.

  3. When the Customize Settings box pops up, click the Edit
      button.

  4. When the Toolbar Editor Dialog box appears, click the
      Programs tab.

  5. Click the Add Program button in the upper right of the
      dialog box.

  6. In the Open File/Browse dialog box that appears, navigate
      to the folder where the Merriam-Webster program is
      installed and click on the Merriam-Webster.exe file to
      highlight it.

  7. Click the OPEN button.

  8. Click OK to close the Toolbar Editor dialog box.

  9. Click CLOSE to close the Customize Toolbar Settings
      dialog box.

 10. Click CLOSE to close the Settings dialog box.


-------------------------------------------------------------
               16. Macintosh Macros and Word X              
-------------------------------------------------------------
Macintosh Microsoft Word users: The first time you attempt
to use the dictionary macro, you may receive a message asking
you to locate the dictionary program. This should occur only 
on the first use; after you have specified the location of
the dictionary, the macro button will simply open the
dictionary and look up the word you specify.

Macintosh Microsoft Word X users: The first release of
Microsoft Word X had problems displaying custom icons, such
as the Merriam-Webster icon, on the toolbar. Microsoft released
a patch that corrects this problem. If you install the Merriam-
Webster macro into your copy of MS Word X and its icon does not
appear, you may need to download and install the Word X patch
from Microsoft's Web site. You can find and download the patch
from  the following Web page:

http://www.microsoft.com/mac/DOWNLOAD/OFFICEX/OfficeX_1012.asp


-------------------------------------------------------------
                17. Troubleshooting Macros                  
-------------------------------------------------------------
You may find that in some cases, the Merriam-Webster macro opens
the appropriate reference, but does not look up your word. This may
occur for several reasons.

In some older word processors, you may need to highlight the
word in your word processing document to activate the automatic
look-up feature.

Another problem can occur because different computers operate at
different speeds. If you have an older computer, it may take several
seconds to open the Merriam-Webster program. As a result, the macro
may be ready to look up a word you highlighted in a word processor
before your computer has opened the reference software. If this
happens, the Merriam-Webster program will open, but your word will
not be looked up automatically.

If this occurs put your cursor in the Merriam-Webster input box, paste
in the highlighted word, and look it up manually. After you have 
looked up the word, switch back to your word processor, but leave
the Merriam-Webster reference open in the background. The next time
you use the macro, it should look up the word automatically.

Advanced users who wish to edit the macro that opens the dictionary can
find instructions on the online FAQ page (see above for the URL).
